## Introduction

70% of traders lose to volatilityâ€”FereAIâ€™s agents plan for 2026 and beyond. In the rapidly evolving world of crypto, short-term speculation often leads to losses. FereAIâ€™s 0xMONK agents are engineered for long-term, sustainable growth, leveraging AI to automate and optimize every aspect of trading.
