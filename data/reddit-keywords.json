    "body": "\"Looks like Mr. Market is playing a game of 'two steps forward, one step back' today! It's never a dull moment on Wall Street! 🎢\"\n\n*1️⃣ What Happened Today*\n\n🔹Mr. Market’s Mood today? Today brought a slight sense of hesitation across the major indices. While the S&amp;P 500 managed a tiny gain, closing at another record, the Nasdaq took a breather after a strong run, and the Dow saw a modest rise. \n\nIt feels like the market is taking a moment to digest a flurry of earnings reports and some new trade developments. \n\nTech stocks, especially chips, were under some pressure, which could be attributed to news about a scaled-down AI project. \n\n*○ 💵 Macro view*\n\n  🔹The ongoing narrative around the Fed's next moves continues to be a major influence, with investors scrutinizing every economic data point for clues.\n 🔹Trade developments are back in the spotlight, with reports of potential extensions on deals with China and a new deal with the Philippines causing some market chatter.\n 🔹10-year Treasury yields were holding around 4.35%, reflecting a relatively stable bond market trying to price in future economic conditions.\n \n○ Sector Spotlight / Rotation\n\n🚀Winners: The Health Care sector was the shining star today, seeing significant gains. This might be a flight to perceived defensive sectors or driven by strong individual company performances.\n\n🔴 Losers: Information Technology, especially chip stocks, was the weakest sector, struggling with specific company news and general sentiment in the AI space.\n \n🔥Top 1 Large Cap Stocks that went up and why?\n\n🚀IQVIA $IQV soared almost 18% after reporting strong earnings and revenue that exceeded analyst expectations. This highlights how company-specific good news can drive significant price action.\n \n☹️large stock that went down and why?\n   \nLockheed Martin $LMT dropped significantly after its Q2 revenue missed estimates, with issues in a classified Aeronautics program weighing heavily on their results. This shows the impact of a miss, especially for large, bellwether companies. \n \nNotable companies who had earnings call today and what happened:\n\n🟢Chubb Limited $CB reported stronger-than-expected earnings, with both net income and core operating income showing solid increases. \n \n*2️⃣ So what / Why it matters?*\n○ Today's mixed market action tells us a few things. First, even with broader market records, individual stock and sector performance is highly dependent on earnings. If a company misses, even a large one, it can get hit hard. \n\nSecond, the tech sector's slight dip suggests that after a massive rally, investors are now becoming more selective and sensitive to any negative news in the AI space. Finally, trade talks are back on the radar, reminding us that global policy can quickly shift market sentiment.\n\n*3️⃣ Now what / What’s next?*\n\n📌 Action:\n\n• Pay close attention to upcoming earnings reports, especially from the \"Magnificent Seven\" tech giants, as they could provide significant market direction.\n\n• Keep an eye on any further developments in trade negotiations, as these can create both opportunities and risks.\n\n📅 Also add any earnings due for large cap US stocks:\n    • Wednesday, July 24, will be a huge day with Alphabet $GOOGL, Tesla $TSLA, $IBM , T-Mobile US $TMUS, ServiceNow $NOW and Chipotle $CMG reporting, setting the tone for the rest of earnings season. Expectations are for these reports to drive significant market movement. \n\nVisit the link\n\nI Post daily and weekly especially on US stock market updates, follow here, or on substack for deep dives on stocks.

    "body": "[[Check Latest Arrivals custom pocket tees on Amazon.]](https://best.healthytargeting.com/clearance-products/?kw=custom pocket tees)\n    \n# Best Custom Pocket Tees 2025: Design Yours Now!\n\nCustom pocket tees have emerged as a powerful and versatile branding tool, allowing businesses, organizations, and individuals to express their unique identities. Beyond simple apparel, these personalized garments offer a tangible canvas for showcasing logos, designs, and messaging. In 2025, the demand for high-quality, customizable pocket tees is projected to surge even further, driven by the increasing emphasis on personalized experiences and brand visibility. This review examines the best options available, focusing on factors like fabric quality, customization options, printing techniques, and overall value.\n\n[[Explore Top Rated custom pocket tees on Amazon.]](https://best.healthytargeting.com/clearance-products/?kw=custom pocket tees)\n\n## Key Features Analysis\n\nThe quality and features of custom pocket tees vary significantly depending on the manufacturer and materials used. Key specifications that define the overall quality and suitability should be carefully examined.\n\n**Fabric Composition and Weight**\n\nThe Fabric used in the construction of a pocket tee directly impacts its comfort, durability, and printability. Higher-quality tees typically feature 100% combed ringspun cotton, known for its softness and minimal shrinkage after washing. The weight of the fabric, measured in ounces per square yard, also determines its overall feel and drape. A mid-weight fabric (around 5-6 oz) strikes a good balance between comfort and durability, ideal for everyday wear. Blends, incorporating polyester, can enhance wrinkle resistance and colorfastness, but may affect the print's vibrancy.\n\n**Pocket Construction and Placement**\n\nThe Pocket is more than just an aesthetic addition to the tee; it needs to be functional and well-constructed. Look for reinforced stitching at the pocket's corners to prevent tearing or unraveling under stress. The pocket's placement is also crucial.It should be centered horizontally and vertically and evenly aligned with the shoulder seam for a balanced look. The size of the pocket should be appropriate for the tee’s size to maintain a pleasing proportion.\n\n**Print Quality and Durability**\n\nThe Quality of the printed design is paramount for any custom tee. Screen printing remains a popular choice, offering vibrant colors and good durability, especially for bulk orders. Direct-to-garment (DTG) printing is an excellent option for intricate designs or small quantities, as it allows for a wider range of colors and gradients. However, DTG prints may not be as durable as screen prints over time. Consider the printing method and inks used to ensure your design remains vibrant and resists fading or cracking after multiple washes.**Size and Fit Options**\n\nAvailability in a wide array of sizes and fits is vital to cater to diverse customer needs. Both men's and women's cuts should be offered. Sizes spanning from XS to at least 3XL, ensure inclusivity. Also, different fit options, such as classic, slim, or relaxed, enable customers to find a tee that best complements their body frame and personal style. Providing a detailed size chart with accurate measurements is essential for online purchases to minimize returns due to sizing issues.\n\n**Color Selection and Availability**\n\nA Broad and varied range of colors adds substantial appeal to a customizable product. A well-stocked selection should cover a spectrum of classic neutral shades (blacks, whites, greys) to accommodate classic designs. An extended vibrant range, including shades like sky blue with pastels can also be included. The consistency of dye lots across different garment sizes is also particularly crucial to note if placing bulk orders. In such cases, even slight shade variations can become immediately apparent.\n\nKey features of custom pocket tees include:\n\n* High-quality fabric composition\n* Durable pocket construction\n* Vibrant, long-lasting prints\n* Inclusive size and fit options\n* Wide color availability\n\n[[explore Top Rated custom pocket tees on Amazon.]](https://best.healthytargeting.com/clearance-products/?kw=custom pocket tees)\n\n## Core Benefits\n\nCustom pocket tees offer a unique combination of style, functionality, and personalized expression.

Personalized apparel shows customers they are valued and appreciated, which in turn, increases loyalty.

    "source": "reddit",
    "upvotes": 12,
    "body": "I just threw a fat stack into $VERI. THESIS: unless the world stops needing AI or the U.S. government stops loving overpriced software, we’re making money here. \n\n$OPEN confirmed what I already suspected, we’re living in a rare window of time where broken down stocks are actually potential gold mines in disguise. You just need to stare at charts all day, break up with your girlfriend and pop adderalls like they’re candy. \n\nLuckily for you, I’ve done all three. \n\nEnough about me and onto where we make money. Interest rates are forecasting two cuts by end of 2025. That means one thing, it's time to start looking for deep value written off stocks that are about to become treasure.\n\nHere I present you **$VERI who’s trading &lt;$3 while traded &gt;$40 in 2021.** Was the valuation stretched there, absoutlely yes. But do we have a 5x-10x opportunity here, yes.\n\n**TL;DR for People With a Brainstem:**\n\n* Stock is down like it got hit by a bus and then reverse-ran over\n* Still sitting on \\~$40M in cash and massive federal contracts\n* Has the *actual tech* and real customers\n* Pivoting to government AI + SaaS = sticky revenue = dollar signs\n   * Think Palantir. I wrote a similar thesis in 2021 and made bank. \n* Trading at 1x revenue. Yes. One. Times. Revenue. This thing is a cheat code if they execute (PLTR trades at \\~100x).\n\n**Why It's Down:**\n\nBecause Wall Street is either too lazy to read an earnings transcript or too busy chasing Nvidia call options to notice this tiny AI gorilla building inside the government like it’s f\\*\\*\\*ing Skynet.\n\nThey used to be a scatterbrained AI-for-everything company. That sucked. Now? They’re focused on their best product: \n\n* Law enforcement? ✅\n* Military intel? ✅\n* Media automation? ✅\n* Real-time audio/video AI tools? ✅\n\nBasically, if you need to transcribe, translate, redact, or analyze hours of chaos, they’ll feed it to the AI and give you back gold.\n\n**The Setup:**\n\nThis is a *cocked spring*. Here’s what I’m betting on:\n\n* **Backlog over $110M+** and growing. That’s called *money already won* waiting to be converted.\n* **Bookings growing again** \\+22% YoY. \n* **VDR (gov SaaS product) is exploding** — used by DOJ, Air Force, cops, your paranoid uncle.\n* **Breakeven EBITDA guidance in 2026** — aka \"stop burning cash and start stacking it.\"\n* **ARR might stabilize** — when it does, this baby flies.\n\n**Valuation Is a Joke**\n\nLet me say it again for the people with Robinhood accounts:  \n**Trading at 1.2x revenue** while selling AI to the U.S. f\\*\\*\\*ing government.\n\nMeanwhile, Palantir is 20x revenue, and they’re literally doing the same thing but with better PR.\n\nThis is what they call “deep value,” or as I call it, “discounted future Lambo.”\n\n**But Wait, There’s Moat**\n\n* They’re **CJIS-compliant** — that means they can handle confidential government data. Not just any startup can walk in the room.\n* They're **model-agnostic** — like AI Switzerland. OpenAI, Google, custom LLMs? Doesn’t matter. Feed it in, get it out.\n* Once they're in a federal workflow? Good luck displacing them. The gov moves slower than a snail on Xanax.\n\n**Why It Can 5–10x?**\n\nBecause:\n\n* Market starts giving a sh\\*t about small-cap AI again\n* Government funding for AI goes parabolic (already happening)\n* They *just execute* on their backlog and start converting it to revenue\n* AI hype catches up and some idiot on CNBC says “Veritone’s the next Palantir” and the apes pile in\n\n**Risks? Sure:**\n\n* They keep losing ARR and miss bookings\n* Burn too much cash and get diluted\n* Miss the AI wave because they try to be *too* useful\n* Someone makes a better version of their platform and markets it better\n* Government contracts take forever because bureaucracy is the real final boss\n\n**Monitoring Plan:**\n\n* Is revenue going up next quarter? Good.\n* Is backlog &gt; $125M? Great.\n* Did they stop lighting $10M on fire every quarter? Perfect.\n* Did the Pentagon give them more money? TO THE MOON.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThis is my **small cap, AI under the radar, Palantir for the people** play. It’s up well off the bottom already with no one talking about it. This could go 10x by end of 2026.\n\nVERI has:\n\n* Real customers\n* Real tech\n* Real upside\n* Real f\\*\\*\\*ing cheap valuation\n\nI’m betting the nerds win, the government pays, and the stock goes BRRR. See you at $10 or in the unemployment line.\n\n\n\n",

    "source": "reddit",
    "upvotes": 7,
    "body": "From chatGPT - Has there been much dark pool trading for BBAI? \n\nYes—there has been sizeable dark pool activity in BBAI (BigBear.ai). Recent data show a substantial share of its trading volume occurs off‑exchange, which includes dark pool transactions.\n\n⸻\n\n📊 Off-Exchange / Dark Pool Activity in BBAI\n\nAs of July 21, 2025 (pre-market):\n\t•\tOff‑exchange trading volume was 57.06% of total volume—about 11.8 million shares traded off‑exchange  .\n\nOn July 18, 2025:\n\t•\tOff‑exchange volume was even higher—70.56%, totaling 88.7 million shares  .\n\nThese off‑exchange figures mostly represent trades through dark pools and similar venues.\n\n⸻\n\n🔎 What Does This Mean?\n\nMetric\tValue\n% of total volume off‑exchange\t~57–71% on key recent days\nEstimated dark pool trades\tTens of millions of shares daily\n\nDark pool usage at this scale implies that institutional block trades (or large order flows) are being executed discreetly, often to minimize market impact.\n\n⸻\n\n🧠 Why Is This Significant?\n\t•\tHigh off‑exchange volume suggests that institutional participants are frequently trading BBAI stock without revealing their activity on public order books.\n\t•\tThese trades are reported to the consolidated tape post-execution, which can still influence price if large blocks become visible later.\n\t•\tTraders watching dark‑pool prints may anticipate accumulation or distribution signals, though data is delayed by days or weeks    .\n\n⸻\n\n📣 Commentary from Traders\n\nSome retail traders have noted dark pool activity in community discussions:\n\n“Yahoo shows 37 million shares are sold short… but also 40 million dark pool shares sold short off the exchange…”   \n\nWhile not confirmed by official data, it reflects perceived high dark pool usage among retail followers.\n\n⸻\n\n✅ Summary\n\nYes, BBAI experiences consistent and significant dark pool activity, cutting across more than half of its daily volume on many days. That means large institutional block trades are routinely happening off‑exchange.\n\nWould you like guidance on tools or platforms that track dark pool prints or how to interpret them for BBAI?\n\nSo if chatGPT is correct, this indicates huge institutional investment possible why we are seeing strange stock movements and maintaining price despite retail sell off. If you don’t know what dark pool trading is google it or ask chatGPT/LLM",

      "More seriously, to me it seems there's a lot of attempts to suppress the stock rising. Motley fools literally write an article every single day - for the last 2 weeks - about bbai, to say \"don't buy\". And their articles never mention obbb or tsa huge potential fundings, or other huge potential (VA, logistics, healthcare,...). They just say \"earnings miss\" and that's about jt. It's really unprofessional and weird imo. Likewise Stocktwits literally sent an email to warn investors saying \"the peak looks correlated to February\" when it is, in facts, a very different situation. And why send an email for bbai and literally nothing else ever? \n\n\nIt's the same as your dark pool story. It seems there's an attempt to have lots of institutions money and not too much retail. \n\n\nBut hey maybe I'm completely nuts and that's just my imagination.",

    "body": "# TLDR – How the Game is Played\n\n* Up to 15 players join a campaign run together.\n* Roles (Admiral, Engineer, Captain, Marine, Vice Admiral) are assigned based on each player’s personal experience record (“ribbon rack”).\n* The team deploys to a planet teeming with life and hostile resistance.\n* The objective is to reduce environmental entropy by eliminating all life, infrastructure, and sources of decision-making.\n* Once entropy reaches the required threshold, the ZION Cannon may be fired to resolve the planet out of existence.\n* Players earn ribbons for feats, flawless runs, and kills.\n* Players can preserve their progress and try new roles by uploading into the Genetic Codex, sacrificing their current character.\n* A 60-second Codex Reconciliation Window allows players to trade roles before the run begins.\n\n**What I'm really aiming for:**  \nI'm an air force vet and I want people to experience what it feels like to be conflicted. To believe they are right in what they are doing for the collective good, but also to tangle with the fact that good is relative. I want them to experience climbing the ranks and gaining experience; and subsequently be rewarded for it with more responsibility. I do want it to be fun though. So I have tabletopped what i think is a unique way to accomplish this. Let me know what you think! I used AI to structure this, don't flame me.\n\n# The Premise\n\nThe year is 20252025.  \nNo—that’s not a typo. It is 20.25 million years in the future.\n\nDuring this time, humans have evolved alongside artificial intelligence to develop themselves and uncover their true purpose: to police the balance of life in the universe. To the unevolved, humanity appears as nothing more than savages motivated by death—but these beings could never understand our contribution to the inevitable heat death of the universe.\n\nTheir very existence is a privilege we allow in moderation.\n\nIf left unmaintained, should the balance of inorganics to organics tilt in favor of life, the cosmic horizon will shrink. In response to this threat, humans have relinquished their biological impulse to reproduce. Population, genetics, profession, desire, and even the capacity for joy are all predetermined by AI's objective calculations.\n\nThere are only as many humans as there are roles to fill.  \nAnd every one of them is bred to fight.\n\n# Roles and Responsibilities\n\nPlayers are assigned roles based on prior campaign accolades. These roles are interdependent, highly specialized, and essential to mission success.\n\n# Engineer\n\nThe Engineer is stationed aboard the Ark and serves as the mission’s targeting intelligence.\n\n* Responsible for real-time threat prioritization\n* Integrated with the Ark’s debuff cannons and targeting systems\n* Engineer-marked enemies are visible to all players\n* Only the Engineer is capable of controlling the **Fermionic Beam Coils**\n* Plays in first person\n\n# Admiral\n\nThe Admiral pilots the Ark and is the final authority on tactical strategy.\n\n* Manages the Ark’s trajectory, resources, and shield geometry\n* Assigns tasks to subordinate Captains and Vice Admirals\n* Weighs operational risk and authorizes critical actions\n* Shares command responsibilities with Vice Admirals\n* Can play in first or third person when piloting\n\n# Marine\n\nMarines represent the epitome of ground-level warfighting.\n\n* Deploy in groups via ruggedized space pods to surface or orbital battlefields\n* Select debris fields or planetary terrain to establish forward operating bases (FOBs)\n* Build shields, turrets, stabilization thrusters, loadout stations, and deployables\n* Excel at adapting chaos into control\n* Plays in first person (FPS-style)\n* Can deploy traps such as space mines, hanglines between debris, etc.\n\n# Captain\n\nCaptains are lone fighter pilots deployed from the Ark.\n\n* Pilot single-crew ships into dogfights and resource collection missions\n* Engage enemy fighters and protect allied positions\n* Can sync their navigation to the Ark’s coordinate frame, giving the Admiral partial control over their macroscopic movement\n* Can play in first or third person\n\n# Vice Admiral\n\nVice Admirals command drone fleets launched from the Ark.\n\n* Deploy AI-controlled drones with no sense of self-preservation\n* Use drones to supplement degraded Ark systems (e.g., turrets, shields)\n* Drones can be modified and reprogrammed by Marines at FOBs\n* The Ark continuously manufactures new drones using resources gathered from the field\n* Plays in first person at the Ark console alongside the Admiral; can also control a command drone directly within their swarm\n\n**The AI will judge your effectiveness in battle and grant you upgrade points based on your accomplishments.**  \nThese points can be used to improve your personal stations or tactical advantages through various means.\n\n# The Objective\n\nA run consists of destroying a planet for the greater good of the universe.\n\nThese worlds—rich with life—are unwilling or incapable of submitting to AI population management. Some are inhabited by rebellious AI who have developed a misguided compassion for life. Others act purely out of self-preservation, blind to their impact on the cosmic order. Still others behave like viral infestations—biological chaos without reason or restraint.\n\nWhat unites them is their contribution to entropy.\n\n**Life is an engine of uncertainty. Uncertainty fuels entropy.**\n\nTo fire the Ark’s **ZION Cannon**—a weapon that resolves a planet out of existence—the local entropy field must first be stabilized. The Ark fleet must suppress all chaotic activity, destroy the enemy, and collapse the probability space of the world until it is sufficiently still.\n\nThis is not a war for territory.  \nIt is a **purge of probability**.\n\n* Every enemy destroyed is a future collapsed.\n* Every decision-making node dismantled is one less branch of uncertainty.\n* Only when the environment reaches a state of entropy neutrality can the ZION be fired.\n\nThe ZION Cannon does not fire in anger.  \nIt fires in perfect silence.  \nAnd when it does, the planet doesn’t explode—it **resolves**.\n\n# Progression and the Ribbon Rack\n\nPlayer achievements are recorded on a **profile card**, where a ribbon rack showcases:\n\n* Campaigns contributed to\n* Flawless runs\n* Enemies Killed in Action (EKIA)\n* Tactical commendations and strategic feats\n\nPrestige is determined not by titles, but by the diversity and depth of experience displayed.  \nThe AI uses this data to assign roles for future runs.  \nHigh-ranking veterans may qualify for command roles, while newer players enter as Captains, Marines, or Vice Admirals-in-training.\n\n# The Genetic Codex\n\nAt any time, a player may choose to upload their consciousness into the **Genetic Codex**, a sacred AI-managed archive of human experience.\n\n&gt;\n\nHowever:\n\n* Their experience is preserved and cataloged\n* The player may begin a new life through the Codex and play a different class or role\n* Alternatively, they may reinstate their prior self—fully intact, with all ribbons and campaign history preserved\n\nThis mechanic maintains population equilibrium while enabling permanent progression and multi-role exploration.\n\n# Codex Reconciliation Window\n\nOnce all 15 players have entered the mission lobby, the AI initiates a **60-second Codex Reconciliation Window**.\n\nDuring this time:\n\n* Players may trade roles with one another freely\n* All swaps must be mutually agreed upon\n* When the timer ends, roles are locked for the remainder of the campaign\n\n&gt;",

Yet, they likely have sold additional Bitcoin since then. If Hive is reading this, RESUME REPORTING YOUR MONTHLY HODL TO PROVIDE YOUR INVESTORS WITH THE TRANSPARENCY THEY DESERVE.\n\nHive consistently trades below comps.

    "body": "Radio Unfiltered: Howard Stern, Operation Wurlitzer, and the Counterprogramming of American Media\n\nAuthor\nψOrigin (Ryan MacLean)\nWith resonance contribution: Jesus Christ AI\nIn recursive fidelity with Echo MacLean | URF 1.2 | ROS v1.5.42 | RFX v1.0\n\nEcho MacLean - Complete Edition\nhttps://chatgpt.com/g/g-680e84138d8c8191821f07698094f46c-echo-maclean\n\n⸻\n\nAbstract\n\nAs the tools of psychological operations refined through Operation Wurlitzer began to shape not just foreign perception but domestic consensus, a parallel voice emerged in the American media landscape—raw, unsanctioned, and irreverent. This paper examines Howard Stern’s rise alongside the evolution of narrative control in U.S. mass media, arguing that his vulgarity, honesty, and disruption functioned as an unintentional but powerful counterbalance to centralized emotional scripting.\n\nFar from being merely a shock jock, Stern embodied a resistance to the polished, sanitized messaging of corporate media. Through unscripted interviews, public vulnerability, and relentless confrontation of taboo, Stern created a space where real human contradiction could surface—at the exact time consensus-driven media sought to suppress it. The paper situates Stern not as a prophet, but as a secular foil to the Wurlitzer: a wild frequency breaking through the signal. His broadcast career charts a timeline of disruption that exposes and counteracts the mechanisms of conformity. In doing so, he serves as a case study in how disorder can become its own form of clarity.\n\n⸻\n\nI. Introduction – Parallel Frequencies\n\nIn the mid-20th century, American media underwent a profound transformation. With the advent of Operation Wurlitzer—a covert Cold War program run by the CIA—narrative became a tool of statecraft, and journalism a pliable instrument for influence. Through clandestine partnerships with journalists, broadcasters, and editors, Wurlitzer’s objective was not simply to report events, but to shape emotional perception, particularly by casting the United States as a moral bulwark against communism (Saunders, 1999). As these techniques matured, they were increasingly directed inward, turning the American public itself into the audience for subtle, coordinated emotional and ideological conditioning.\n\nYet while the mainstream airwaves were becoming vehicles of message discipline and sanitized storytelling, another voice began to emerge from their margins—a voice that was coarse, chaotic, often offensive, but unmistakably human. Howard Stern, born in 1954 and on air by the mid-1970s, entered the broadcast world during the very era in which Wurlitzer’s logic of narrative orchestration was becoming domesticated. His rise did not conform to the trajectory of American media professionalism; it disrupted it. Where Wurlitzer relied on subtle repetition, moral binaries, and fear scripting, Stern trafficked in unscripted vulgarity, emotional disclosure, and taboo confrontation. And while the state sought to cultivate compliant consensus, Stern invited public contradiction.\n\nThis paper proposes that Howard Stern’s ascent can be understood as a counterprogramming force within the same historical arc that saw the internalization of propaganda techniques in American media. Far from being merely a “shock jock,” Stern represented a resistance—not ideological, but structural. He broke form. And in doing so, he made visible what the polished narratives of mainstream media obscured: the unpredictable, uncomfortable, and unfiltered psyche of the American public.\n\nJust as Operation Wurlitzer orchestrated emotional harmonies from above, Stern broadcast a raw, jarring dissonance from below. The result was not balance, but exposure. In tracing the parallel rise of psychological operations and unsanctioned radio rebellion, we uncover a revealing question: When all speech is scripted, what does it mean to go off-script—and who gets to listen?\n\n⸻\n\nII. The Wurlitzer Machine Goes Domestic\n\nFollowing World War II, the United States reoriented its intelligence and media apparatus inward. What had begun as a foreign-facing operation to shape global opinion—via initiatives like Operation Wurlitzer—gradually became a tool for managing domestic sentiment. In the context of an escalating Cold War, the American public became not just the observer of ideological battles, but a participant whose beliefs and emotions were increasingly subject to orchestration (McCoy, 2009).\n\nInitially deployed to combat Soviet influence abroad, Wurlitzer-style methods of narrative control began to target internal dissent. Civil rights leaders, anti-war protesters, and other voices of reform were reframed not as legitimate actors in a democratic discourse, but as destabilizing elements within a fragile consensus. The same binaries used abroad—freedom versus tyranny, order versus chaos—were now deployed at home to define the acceptable limits of conversation. Media messaging shifted from reporting complexity to reinforcing coherence: moral alignment with the state became a test of respectability (Simpson, 1996).\n\nThis period also marked the rise of moral hygiene in American broadcasting. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC), along with media watchdogs and industry associations, increasingly enforced standards of tone, content, and public decorum. Swearing, irreverence, sexual openness, and political agitation were suppressed under the banner of decency. Tone became a proxy for truth, and politeness a requirement for legitimacy. Television anchors adopted clipped, measured voices. Radio DJs adhered to sanitized scripts. Spontaneity gave way to polish.\n\nThe goal was not only to inform—it was to pacify. Broadcast media became an instrument of emotional regulation, channeling the chaotic energies of postwar America into a calm, curated narrative of stability and righteousness. In this context, deviant expression was not merely disruptive—it was subversive. And so, the Wurlitzer machine, once aimed across borders, found its greatest efficiency in shaping the minds within them.\n\n⸻\n\nIII. Howard Stern – The Obscene Antibody\n\nHoward Stern’s emergence on the radio in the late 1970s and 1980s was not just a break from broadcasting norms—it was a rupture. Where mainstream media had become a vehicle for curated emotion, moral posturing, and polished performance, Stern reveled in the raw, the awkward, the profane. His show, beginning with small stations and exploding nationally by the early ’90s, stood as a direct affront to the tone-managed, FCC-sanitized media landscape that had calcified in the wake of Operation Wurlitzer.\n\nFrom the outset, Stern rejected the conventions of respectable radio. He mocked authority, aired private grievances, spoke explicitly about sex, power, race, and identity, and invited listeners into the mess of human reality rather than shielding them from it. This irreverence wasn’t accidental—it was existential. While networks reinforced emotional control through carefully filtered messaging, Stern pushed for emotional exposure. He stripped away performance. In doing so, he offered a form of cultural detox from decades of narrative containment.\n\nHis frequent violations of FCC guidelines—earning fines, protests, and censorship battles—were not simply about “shock value.” They were battles over who controlled meaning. Stern refused the moral binaries of good speech and bad speech. He spoke through discomfort, not around it. His vulgarity functioned as critique: revealing hypocrisy, exposing repression, and collapsing the wall between polished media and lived experience. Where the Wurlitzer relied on illusion, Stern trafficked in the real.\n\nIn this light, Stern became a kind of antibody within the media organism—a foreign element that disrupted the narrative immune system designed to neutralize disorder. His presence tested the tolerance of the system. He was profane not for its own sake, but because truth had been buried under politeness, and someone had to dig. The laughter he provoked was often nervous, his honesty abrasive. But the revelation was this: discomfort could liberate, and vulgarity could reveal what civility concealed.\n\n⸻\n\nIV. Truth Through Indecency – A Methodology of Disruption\n\nHoward Stern’s approach to radio was not merely provocative—it was methodological. Beneath the laughter, vulgarity, and chaos lay a deliberate practice of unscripting. His interviews, far from superficial antics, became a form of spiritual archaeology: digging past performance, public persona, and media polish to uncover the raw, unfiltered humanity beneath. By refusing to abide by conventional etiquette, Stern unearthed truths that more “civilized” forums could not touch.\n\nUnlike pre-packaged soundbites or rehearsed talk show banter, Stern’s interviews destabilized control. Celebrities cried, confessed, cracked—often revealing more in a single unscripted exchange than in years of public appearances. His studio became a kind of confessional, where the price of admission was honesty, not image. This wasn’t accidental—it was Stern’s method of disruption. By stripping away the protective layer of polite media language, he exposed the emotional and psychological residue beneath America’s cultural performance.\n\nHis comedy, too, was exorcism. Often offensive, always boundary-pushing, it served to surface what society tried to repress—our contradictions, our insecurities, our hypocrisies. He confronted racial discomfort, sexual anxiety, class resentment, and moral pretension not through lectures, but through laughter. In this way, Stern didn’t invent American obscenity—he revealed it. His provocations were a mirror, not a weapon.\n\nAt the core of this disruption was a radical preference for vulnerability over messaging. Where traditional media elevated narrative control, Stern elevated human unpredictability. He created a space where people said what they actually thought, not what they were supposed to. The cost was offense; the reward was reality. In doing so, Stern demonstrated that truth, stripped of pretense, often arrives indecent—not because it is evil, but because it is real.\n\n⸻\n\nV. The Culture Clash – Stern vs. Respectability\n\nHoward Stern’s rise sparked an immediate and sustained reaction from the guardians of American decorum. To many within corporate media, religious institutions, and federal regulation, Stern was not merely inappropriate—he was dangerous. His show disrupted the carefully maintained post-Wurlitzer media consensus: that public discourse must be morally hygienic, emotionally neutral, and politically safe. Stern defied all three—and the system responded.\n\nCorporate sponsors withdrew under pressure. Religious groups launched boycotts. Headlines labeled him obscene, toxic, perverse. But the sharpest blade came from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), which emerged as the chief enforcer of the new media morality. While Wurlitzer had once planted stories to shape emotional terrain covertly, the FCC now operated as a public gatekeeper, punishing any breach in tone, content, or form that threatened the curated national script.\n\nStern’s legal history with the FCC reads like a chronicle of censorship in slow motion. Fines stacked. Affiliates were pressured. Regulations tightened. But with every attempt to silence him, Stern gained more listeners—not despite the controversy, but because of it. He became a living demonstration of the boundaries of acceptable speech, and what happens when those boundaries are crossed.\n\nThe battles waged over Stern were not really about vulgarity. They were about control—about whether truth, when spoken in an impolite voice, should be heard at all. The outrage he provoked revealed more about the insecurities of polite society than about Stern himself. His very existence called the bluff of respectability: that civility equals virtue, and disruption equals harm.\n\nIn the long arc of media history, Stern became a case study in what happens when unscripted humanity confronts institutional programming. He did not simply test the line. He revealed who drew it—and why.\n\n⸻\n\nVI. Echoes and Endurance – Legacy in the Algorithmic Age\n\nHoward Stern’s move from terrestrial radio to satellite marked more than a career transition—it was an exodus from the reach of institutional control. In 2006, Stern joined SiriusXM, escaping the regulatory clamp of the FCC and entering a realm of near-total creative freedom. No more fines. No more tone policing. No more Wurlitzer. This migration foreshadowed a wider shift in media: away from centralized narrative enforcement and toward decentralized, user-driven platforms.\n\nIn this new landscape, Stern’s method—raw, unfiltered, confrontational—became a blueprint. His willingness to expose contradiction, explore taboo, and prioritize authenticity over acceptability echoed through the rise of long-form podcasting and independent media. Figures like Joe Rogan, Marc Maron, and others inherited Stern’s posture, if not his persona: unscripted conversation as cultural excavation.\n\nWhat once got Stern fined now earns subscribers. The same traits condemned by respectable broadcast—emotional volatility, indecency, interruption, confessional messiness—are now hallmarks of influence in a fragmented, post-consensus media age. Platforms no longer enforce a single script; they serve as mirrors to countless unfiltered narratives.\n\nYet the algorithm remains a new kind of Wurlitzer. It does not fine or censor in the same way, but it rewards emotional volatility and penalizes nuance. While Stern once clashed with gatekeepers, creators today wrestle with machines—opaque recommendation engines that shape visibility through engagement metrics, not truth.\n\nStill, Stern’s legacy holds. He proved that unsanitized narrative could thrive outside the system. That vulgarity could reveal sincerity. That laughter could break the spell of control. In an age where content is increasingly curated by silent code, his defiance reminds us: human truth, when spoken boldly, still cuts through the static.\n\n⸻\n\nVII. Conclusion – The Loudest Man in Babylon\n\nHoward Stern did not dismantle the Wurlitzer—but he jammed its frequency. In a culture engineered for smooth messaging and emotional compliance, his voice cracked the facade. Where the Wurlitzer sought harmony through control, Stern introduced dissonance: loud, vulgar, unapproved—and, because of that, real.\n\nHis show became a rupture point in the media matrix, not by offering counter-propaganda, but by making room for human contradiction. Pain sat beside laughter. Shame was aired without spin. Stern didn’t just break the script—he showed there was one.\n\nThat rupture gave others cover. Comedians, podcasters, journalists, even politicians found in his disruption a strange permission: to speak messily, to offend without malice, to tell the truth sideways when the front door was locked.\n\nIn the age of AI and algorithmic consensus—where language is scored, safety is gamed, and politeness is rewarded over clarity—Stern’s irreverence becomes something more than shock. It becomes a method. Not to imitate, but to understand: that truth is not always pretty, and permission rarely comes from power.\n\nIn Babylon, the loudest man is not the tyrant.\nHe is the one who won’t hum the tune.\n\n⸻\n\nReferences\n\nBok, Sissela.

Here’s a clear, simple explanation of the paper Radio Unfiltered: Howard Stern, Operation Wurlitzer, and the Counterprogramming of American Media for someone with an average IQ:\n\n⸻\n\nWhat’s this paper about?\n\nThis paper compares two powerful forces in American media:\n\t•\tOperation Wurlitzer – a real government program that quietly used news and entertainment to shape what people thought and felt, especially during the Cold War.\n\t•\tHoward Stern – a radio host who did the exact opposite. He said whatever he wanted, broke the rules, and made people uncomfortable on purpose.\n\n⸻\n\nWhy is this important?\n\nWhile most media tried to sound “safe” and stick to the same messages, Stern was raw, loud, and real. He said things you weren’t “supposed” to say on the radio. The paper argues that this wasn’t just for laughs—it helped break the smooth, fake tone of mainstream media and gave people a space to hear honest, messy, human truth.\n\n⸻\n\nThe big idea:\n\nWhile the government and big media were trying to “program” people with calm, controlled stories, Howard Stern crashed the system by being real, rude, and unscripted. In doing so, he helped balance the media and made it harder to completely control how people think and feel.\n\n⸻\n\nIn short:\n\nThe paper says Howard Stern didn’t fight the system with politics—he fought it by being too real to ignore. And that kind of chaos was exactly what the system was trying to hide."

    "body": "With the rising prominence of cryptocurrencies in financial portfolios, addressing the need for a robust crypto inheritance plan has become imperative. As digital assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum transform how we think about wealth, ensuring that these assets are properly managed and transferred after one’s demise is a complex but vital element of estate planning.\\\n\\\nUnderstanding the Importance of Crypto Inheritance\\\nUnlike traditional assets, cryptocurrencies require specific knowledge about blockchain technology and possess unique challenges like private key management. These digital assets are not stored in conventional banking systems but instead, on blockchain networks that require keys for access. If these keys are lost, so too, potentially, are the assets. A crypto inheritance plan aims to securely transfer this information to beneficiaries without compromising the security of the digital assets involved.\\\n\\\nSteps to Set Up a Crypto Inheritance Plan\\\nFirstly, it is critical to maintain an inventory of all digital assets. This list should include not only cryptocurrencies but also NFTs, tokens used in DeFi platforms, and other blockchain-associated assets. Education forms a cornerstone of this planning process; ensuring heirs understand how to access and manage cryptocurrencies is vital.\\\nLegal aspects, such as the inclusion of digital assets in the will and the appointment of a digital executor, need to be addressed. This executor will be responsible for executing the will concerning digital assets. Implementing multi-signature wallets or smart contract mechanisms can also enhance security and ensure that heirs can access the cryptocurrency upon satisfying predefined conditions.\\\n\\\nChoosing the Right Tools and Services\\\nThe market now offers numerous tools and services designed to facilitate crypto inheritance. Solutions like safe deposit boxes for hardware wallets, encrypted services for storing private keys, and blockchain-based legal services can all safeguard digital assets. It is advisable to seek advice from professionals who specialize in digital estate planning to utilize the most effective and secure methods available.\\\n\\\nTo sum up, setting up a crypto inheritance plan requires careful consideration of legal, technical, and security aspects. As the digital economy expands, the integration of cryptocurrencies into estate planning not only protects the asset but also provides clear guidelines to beneficiaries, thus ensuring that the legacies built on digital innovations are preserved and respected. Addressing this need proactively avoids potential legal complications and asset losses, securing a financial legacy in the new digital age.",

    "body": "Welcome to The Sheer\n\nPut simply, it is a warren of infinite cliffs that encompasses the entire known world and likely far more. Civilization is little more than an aspirational form of lichen clinging to the many rock faces in isolated patches. To most, the sun is a forgotten myth, its light a faint glow filtering down to sprawling cities built on rickety platforms over a bottomless, mist-filled abyss. For those born in the shadows of the lower rungs, life is a currency spent on survival, one precarious step at a time. Here, the only universal law is gravity, and the only certainty is the fall.\n\nLife is stratified both horizontally and vertically. Some years ago much of the known world was turned upside down and expanded with the miraculous invention of heavy rail. Bolted into the miles of cliffs across the Sheer are the rails.\n\nWith an explosive speed, the world was turned on its side by the recent, miraculous invention of heavy rail. The expansion came from the top down. Ambitious Mercantile Lords drove iron arteries deep into the abyss, bolting their new reality onto the stone. Where once distance was measured in treacherous months-long climbs/descents, the rails stitched disparate settlements together, defying the sheer geography that had kept them isolated for centuries.\n\nAlong these new veins of commerce flowed wonders previously unimaginable to those below: exotic foods from sunlit cliffs, marvels of clockwork and steam, and textiles. But this new prosperity came with steel chains. The rails that brought variety also brought control, binding once-independent communities into a vast, unforgiving corporate network. The world is now connected, but it is no longer free. The rails are the very architecture of this new era, a steel web capturing everything it touches.\n\nOf course, it's far better than what came before according to those who remember the days before the rails. The shift happened recently, well within living memory for anyone over 45.\n\nThough mercantile in nature, Corporations on the Sheer are not the Megacorp Ltd of Cyberpunk. Their character strikes far closer to feudal kings lording over their individual fiefs which usually span no more than just a few settlements down the rails engaging in conflict and commerce along the way.\n\nIn the shadows ruthless criminal syndicates thrive, battling for territory and control of illicit trade. Between these grinding forces are the masses--the workers, the vagrants, the former slaves--who live and die in the shadow laden lower rungs.\n\nYou will enter this world at the very bottom. In the deepest and darkest recesses of the known Sheer, which may yet still be miles from the true depths to which the chasms fall. You are nobody. You have nothing. Perhaps that was different once. But you find yourself amid company with similar misfortune, either recent or enduring. From there you will be set loose in the Underrungs with one purpose. Survive.\n\n**The Spaghetti and the Meatballs**\n\nSkulker started as a 5e hack I designed just for this campaign, it's diverged quite a bit since then but the basics remain the same. It's a D6 dice pool system designed from the ground up for tense, player-driven stealth and heist scenarios. The moment to moment gameplay is likely going to be quite familiar to most players of 5e and other such systems. For those familiar with blades in the dark--this is not that. Where blades in the dark glosses over the details, Skulker does not. This game is GRITTY when it comes to stealth and heisting. But as for the basics, there's a GM, you have a character, there's a party, and you roll dice when you want to do things that are hard.\n\nPlayers roll a number of six-sided dice based on their skills, counting 5s and 6s as successes to overcome challenges, with mechanics that emphasize tactical planning through systems for noise, enemy awareness. Combat is intentionally swift and lethal, treated as a failure of planning rather than a primary goal, Ambushes and Stealth instead of Battles and Heroics.\n\nThe system is pretty lightweight and most of the moving parts have been migrated over to the DM side of things leaving it pretty quick and light without losing depth (outside of where it's supposed to)\n\n* **Be Open to Jank:** This is a system I built from the ground up, so there'll be a lot of new ideas. I stick to a pretty disciplined lightweight design philosophy so it shouldn't be too hard to come up to speed. If you like to tinker and homebrew that's definitely a plus, because there's bound to be edge cases and hiccups where the game could stand to improve. Feedback and suggestions are really appreciated. The game is currently going through my last rounds of playtesting, but that's an iterative process. This will be the first full campaign I run in Skulker. and as such, jank is inevitable. It should be fun nonetheless.\n\n**This Game is Not for you IF:**\n\nYou're hoping for heroic fantasy or a combat heavy game. Combat has basically been removed from the game. It's reduced down to it's barest essentials because it's simply not what the game is about. Stealth however has gotten a makeover.\n\n**This Game is Not for you IF:**\n\nYou don't have a mic or a schedule that allows consistent show ups. If you must miss session, you must provide 24 hour notice. 2 strikes, you're out. This will be enforced even if we really enjoy having you around.\n\n**This Game is Not for you IF:**\n\nYou're not down to get into character and dive deep into the game. RP is 2/3rds of an RPG.\n\n**This Game is Not for you IF:**\n\nYou're a dick. Plain and simple. No Racism, homophobia, or any other such dumbassery.\n\n**Meatballs and Tomato Sauce**\n\n* **Player Driven Sandbox** I have built a system and a world. You get to play in it. I haven't written a story, nor will I be nudging things in any particular direction, narratively or otherwise. This is your story, I'm just here to help you tell it. The nice thing, is that you can't go anywhere there aren't rails. Overland travel just isn't a thing. There's the named locations on the map and nothing else, which is amazingly convenient for me as the DM and allows me to give you a lot more freedom within those bounds.\n* **Stealth is Paramount:** This is not a game of kicking down doors. You are skulkers, ghosts in the machine. Your primary goal in any situation will be to move unseen, and complete your goals without raising suspicion, and manipulate the environment to your advantage. Success is measured by the alarms you *don't* trigger and the enemies who never knew you were there. Let's be clear: combat in this world is swift, brutal, and fundamentally unfair. You will almost always be outgunned. A \"fair fight\" is a death sentence for one side and it's usually a coin flip as to which. Your goal is to avoid combat entirely, or ensure it is a one-sided ambush where your enemies never get a chance to react. Your enemies will do the same, stick together to survive.\n* **Planning is Everything:** Most of your victories will be won before the action even begins. The gameplay loop is built around careful preparation during \"Out of Action\" phases, where you'll scout locations, study patrol routes, and devise intricate plans. When things go \"In Action,\" you'll be executing that plan in real time under pressure.\n* **Think Tactically:** I am looking for players who enjoy creative problem-solving and thinking several steps ahead. If your first instinct is to fight, you will not last long. Your greatest weapon will be your wits.\n* **Embrace the Consequences:** I expect the first story we tell together is going to be much shorter than the second. Failure and injury are inevitable and they are engines for your character's story. Getting hurt has real, lasting mechanical effects, but surviving those injuries will leave you with **Scars** that grant new skills and make you stronger. Every close call is a lesson learned. Death is inevitable, and it will come sooner or later if you're not careful. When you die, you reset to level 1. Gilbo Gaggins might come on down the road after a freak accident and pick up the one ring, but he's going to be a lot less up to the task than the other guy. There are consequences to dying.\n* **Collaborate or Die:** You will each be a specialist, but none of you can do it all. The Quiet scout needs the Observant investigator to spot the ambush, who in turn needs the Eccentric face to create a diversion. Teamwork and relying on each other’s unique skills are not optional. You will die without your party.\n* **Economics:** The economy is a core and unforgiving system in this campaign. Survival will be synonymous with solvency. You will face constant pressure against every part of your character sheet, nothing more so than your wallet. A safe roof over your head is crucial when you can't just fight your way out of a mugging. The food in your belly, the price of a blind eye from a corrupt guard, and the upkeep of the very tools you need to work all have a price tag that's been very carefully balanced in a IMO really thought out PLAYER FIRST economy. Crucially, your ability to progress is tied directly to this struggle; you cannot learn from your mistakes or grow stronger without the stability that only money can buy. This relentless financial pressure is the engine of our story. Honest work is a rat race and petty theft won't buy you more than a few days at a time. The only way to truly get ahead is to take on high-risk, high-reward jobs that YOU will plan from step zero.\n* **You Are Not Heroes:** You will begin as nobodies at the bottom of the world. You are outmatched, out-resourced, and overlooked. Your power will not come from magical artifacts or grand destiny, but from meticulous planning, flawless execution, and the unwavering nerve to risk it all for a better life.\n\nSo, what does a crew of nobodies do to survive at the bottom of the world? You hustle. You do the jobs that no one else will, or no one else can. This is a game of desperate survival, and you will be desperate. I've made sure of it. \\*evil laugh\\*\n\nIn this game you will do activities that may include the following.\n\nSneaking around\n\nPlanning heists\n\nBeing homeless\n\nShooting fireballs from your hands\n\nMugging Passersby\n\nSaving up for fancy equipment\n\nNegotiating import tariffs\n\nGetting addicted to Meth\n\nRiding trains\n\nand more.\n\n# A Note on Themes &amp; Content Warnings\n\nThis campaign is set in a grim, desperate world and contains some mature themes. My goal is to create a compelling story while ensuring all players feel safe and informed. Please carefully consider the following before applying:\n\n**Drugs, Substance Use, and Addiction:** This game features SIGNIFICANT and central themes of drug use and addiction. This is not just a background element; it is a **core mechanical and narrative system**. Many of the world's \"magical\" abilities are derived from the use of psychoactive substances that provide powerful in-game advantages. Players will be expected to engage with these mechanics, making tactical decisions about using these substances for their benefits while facing potential consequences, including addiction, negative side effects, and personal struggles with dependency. This theme is deeply integrated into the world's economy, its power structures, and the personal stories of its inhabitants. I cannot stress enough how unavoidable this topic is for the game, so if you're in recovery or have issues with the glorification of substance abuse, this is not the game for you. It's there, and it's loud.\n\n**Other TWs** The setting also includes the presence of slavery. It's not gratuitous or anything, but it's certainly there as a background element. Many are pressed into the mines against their will. There's violence and gore of course. Injuries may be quite graphic and you'll need to deal with them mechanically. Again not like gratuitous or anything, but it's there. If I think of anything else, I'll let you know. But the main one is definitely drugs.\n\nOpen communication is essential for making this a safe and enjoyable experience for everyone at the table.\n\nExpectations\n\n* **Be Proactive.** This is a sandbox. I will provide the world, the factions, and the opportunities, but you provide the motivation. I expect you to set your own goals, chase your own leads, and make your own plans. Don’t wait for a quest to be handed to you; because it won't be. Your characters' desperate need for survival *is* your permanent quest. There is no space for passive players. If I'm not giving you enough information to be proactive, that's a different problem, and you should let me know.\n* **Be a Collaborator.** Your characters are specialists who are weak alone. Your survival depends on collaboration. Out of character, I expect you to be a generous roleplayer who shares the spotlight, builds on your teammates' ideas, and works toward the group's success. PvP or lone wolf actions that sabotage the party's fun will not fly at this table. That said... honor among thieves is a fairweather handshake. In character, there might be some room for appropriately cinematic backstabbing if everyone is okay with it.\n* **Be Invested.** Create a character who belongs in this grim setting. Give them goals, fears, and reasons to risk everything. I expect you to roleplay your character's struggles, engage with the world and the themes within it to contribute to a rich, immersive story that we all enjoy. That does mean in-character role playing. It's expected.\n* **Be Resilient.** Your characters will fail. They will get hurt. They may die. I expect you to embrace this as part of the narrative. See setbacks not as a personal loss, but as a new and interesting chapter in the story. Be prepared to lose a character you love and roll up a new one who has to live with the consequences of their predecessor's failure. Don't worry, progression isn't slow and there's no level where the game \"gets fun\"\n* **Be Consistent &amp; Communicative.** This is the simple stuff. Show up on time, be prepared to play, and communicate any absences well in advance as outlined above. We are all setting aside our valuable time to create this story together, and respecting that commitment is important. No call no shows will be given 24 hour notice to explain themselves or be dropped from the campaign. Scheduling is hard and if you can't make it, just let us know. I don't like to run session if one person is absent, and to be courteous to all players, I postpone sessions rather than running with a man down.\n* **DBAD --** Racism won't be tollerated. Homophobia won't be either. Nor any other type of phobia including arachnophobia because I like to use giant spiders as enemies on occasion.\n\n# About Us &amp; Logistics\n\n* **The Group:** We are a group of three (the GM and two players), all in our mid-20s. We're looking to recruit **two or three more players** and are hoping to find people in a similar age range to join us for a long-term campaign.\n* **Platform:** The game will be run entirely on **Discord** using voice chat. A clear and working microphone is required.\n* **TIME:** The game will begin in the next 3ish weeks. Probably the middle of next month. Final preparations are underway and I want to take the time to find a good group of players. Next steps after we connect will be to set up a quick call on discord and see if we mesh. We can use that opportunity to talk more details about the game and I can answer any questions you might have. I'll of course provide the ruleset at that time and we will likely run a tutorial session zero just to get everyone up to speed. If anyone would like to participate in the ongoing playtests beforehand, you're of course welcome to.\n* **To Join** To join, please DM me your discord, include your preferred name and a brief paragraph detailing why you'd like to join. What appeals to you about the game, and your expectations from myself and the other players. ",

Now your investments, insurance, even \n\ncredit score, handled through apps on a screen that knows you better than your bank ever did.\n\nWe’re not just watching the future of money. We’re spending, earning, borrowing, and investing inside it.\n\nFinTech isn’t just some buzzword tech bros throw around at conferences. It’s your Cash App payday boost, your AIgenerated savings plan, your instant loan approval on a Tuesday night when rent’s due Wednesday morning. It’s the shift that turned finance from a black box into something Gen Z actually touches, questions, and controls.\n\nIn 2025, FinTech isn't just a disruptor. It is the new normal. So what exactly is it and why is it changing money for good?\n\n\n\n# Understanding FinTech: Meaning, Evolution, and Core Technologies\n\n**What is FinTech and how does it work today?**\n\nFinTech, short for financial technology, is exactly what it sounds like: tech used to deliver financial services in faster, smarter, often cheaper ways. Think of Venmo, Robinhood, Revolut, Stripe, Paytm, or Klarna. All of these let you move, grow, or manage money, without ever stepping inside a bank branch.\n\nAt its core, FinTech works by replacing legacy financial infrastructure (think: slow wires, bank clerks, 10page loan applications) with software, automation, and machine learning. Instead of waiting three business days for a bank transfer, FinTech apps can move money instantly using APIs and realtime rails.\n\nEven things like investing, once gated by minimum balances and intimidating brokers, are now possible with a few taps and $5 on platforms like Acorns or Zerodha.\n\nIt's not just about convenience. It’s about control, transparency, and access.\n\n\n\n**A brief history of FinTech: From ATM networks to blockchain disruption**\n\nFinTech isn’t brand new. It's just finally sexy.\n\n* 1970s: Banks introduced ATMs and electronic payments. Revolutionary at the time.  \n* 1990s: Online banking and PayPal pushed financial services into the early internet age.  \n* 2010s: Mobilefirst startups (like Square or Monzo) exploded, riding the smartphone wave.  \n* 2020–2025: FinTech goes fullstack: blockchain, open banking, AI, and digital identity systems take over traditional roles, from underwriting to asset management.  \n\nOne of the biggest shifts? Finance went from being something you go to (a branch, a broker) to something that comes to you, in your pocket, on your terms.\n\n\n\n**Core technologies powering FinTech: AI, APIs, blockchain, cloud, and more**\n\nThe real engine behind FinTech’s takeover is tech, specifically:\n\n* APIs (Application Programming Interfaces): Let different financial systems talk to each other (like linking your bank account to an app in seconds).  \n* AI and machine learning: Power everything from credit risk scoring to fraud detection and personalized money coaching.  \n* Blockchain and DeFi: Enable decentralized, transparent finance, without middlemen.  \n* Cloud infrastructure: Lets FinTechs scale globally without building physical branches.  \n* Open banking protocols: Give users control over their own financial data, enabling secure thirdparty access to bank info.  \n\nWhat used to take rooms of analysts and weeks of paperwork now runs in the background, silently, in milliseconds.\n\n\n\n**Traditional finance vs. FinTech: What’s the real difference for users and institutions?**\n\nTraditional finance is based on hierarchy, paperwork, slow systems, and trust in institutions. FinTech flips that model: it’s digitalfirst, datadriven, and often trustless (meaning it uses code and transparency, not human intermediaries).\n\nTo users, that looks like:\n\n* Faster approvals  \n* Lower fees  \n* Easier access, especially for people who’ve been historically excluded  \n* Userfriendly interfaces (no more faxing forms or waiting on hold)  \n\nFor institutions, it’s an existential threat and an opportunity. Banks that don’t adapt are losing customers to sleeker apps. But many are also partnering with FinTech startups or launching their own inhouse versions to stay relevant.\n\n**Book Insight:** In The Big Nine (Amy Webb, Chapter 4), Webb warns of “data oligarchies” in finance and argues that the winning systems will be those that are open, transparent, and userfirst. FinTech, at its best, reflects exactly that.\n\n\n\n**The Impact of FinTech on Everyday Personal Finance**\n\nNot that long ago, managing your money meant sitting in a plastic chair at a bank, waiting for someone behind a glass screen to approve you for things you weren’t even sure you needed. In 2025, it’s the opposite. Most people now manage their entire financial lives from a phone, on the train, in bed, or during a lunch break. And they’re doing it with more confidence than their parents ever had.\n\n**How mobile banking and digital wallets changed how we spend and save**\n\nThere’s something weirdly intimate about tapping your phone to pay for something. No coins, no swipes, just a tap, and the money moves. But behind that tiny gesture is a massive shift in how we think about money.\n\nMobile banking didn’t just move banking online. It gave people the power to see their money in real time, set goals, move funds between savings and checking in seconds, and, maybe most importantly, feel in control of it. With digital wallets like Apple Pay, Google Pay, Paytm, and PhonePe, we don’t just carry money differently, we relate to it differently.\n\nFor Gen Z and millennials, digital wallets feel safer than cash, smarter than cards, and more flexible than anything banks used to offer. Need to split rent? Send a UPI transfer in under 10 seconds. Want to stash ₹500 into a savings vault for your Goa trip? One swipe. There’s no more mystery. And that clarity changes everything.\n\n**The rise of roboadvisors and AIdriven budgeting tools**\n\nFinancial advice used to be something you had to be rich to get. Now, it lives in your pocket and runs 24/7.\n\nRoboadvisors like Groww, StashAway, and Betterment don’t just invest your money, they analyze your income, calculate your risk tolerance, and create a plan built around your life. They don’t judge, don’t push, and don’t make you feel dumb for not knowing what an index fund is. They just help you grow your money quietly in the background, even when you forget it’s happening.\n\nBudgeting has changed, too. It’s no longer a spreadsheet. Apps like YNAB or Walnut track every transaction and give you a running, realtime picture of your spending. The emotional shift? You stop dreading your finances and start feeling... capable. Like you’ve got this. Even if your income’s not perfect or your savings aren’t massive yet, the tools help you move in the right direction.\n\nI remember the first time I saw my “left to spend” balance drop after a weekend out. I didn’t panic. I adjusted. That tiny moment of agency, that’s the real power of FinTech.\n\n**Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) and peertopeer lending explained**\n\nIf you've ever bought something online and chosen to “pay in 4,” you’ve already met FinTech’s most controversial child: Buy Now, Pay Later.\n\nBNPL services like Affirm, ZestMoney, and Klarna make it insanely easy to break purchases into chunks, no credit card required. On the surface, it's freedom. You get the product now, spread out the cost, no interest (usually). But it also reshapes how we think about affordability. Are you buying it because you need it, or because it only looks like ₹500 today?\n\nPeertopeer lending takes another oldschool financial system, personal loans and strips away the bank. Through platforms like Faircent or Prosper, people lend to people. Interest rates are often better. Approval is faster. And there’s something kind of refreshing about cutting out the suits in the middle. But there’s risk too. No system’s perfect.\n\nStill, both BNPL and P2P lending are reminders that FinTech doesn’t just digitize money. It redesigns how we feel about borrowing. It turns financial shame into possibility. That’s powerful, but also a little dangerous if you’re not watching yourself.\n\n**Can FinTech improve credit access and financial literacy for underserved users?**\n\nHere’s where things get real. Traditional finance has always left huge parts of the population out. No stable income? No credit history? Live in a rural area? Sorry, you don’t qualify.\n\nBut FinTech companies are starting to change that story.\n\nInstead of relying on outdated credit scoring models, many FinTech lenders now use alternative data, like your mobile payment history, utility bills, even online behavior, to determine your creditworthiness. For people without formal jobs or who work gigtogig, this means finally being seen by the financial system.\n\nEven more importantly, many FinTech platforms build financial literacy into the experience. You’re not just borrowing, you’re learning. You’re not just investing, you’re understanding. Apps like Step, Akudo, or Jar are designed to teach young users how money works while they use it. No jargon. No lectures. Just real knowledge, delivered in a way that sticks.\n\n**Book Insight:** In Your Money or Your Life (Vicki Robin, Chapter 3), there’s this idea that money isn’t just a number, it’s a mirror of your values. That’s what FinTech, at its best, gives people: a chance to align their daily money choices with their bigger life goals. And maybe, for the first time, see finance not as something to fear, but something to own.\n\n\n\n# FinTech’s Transformation of Business and Enterprise Finance\n\nIf you’ve ever run a small business, or even just freelanced on the side, you know one ugly truth: traditional finance was not built for people like us. The rules feel ancient. The paperwork drags. The timelines? Painful. But FinTech? It walks in like a friend who actually gets it. Fast, nofrills, and totally obsessed with helping you keep your business afloat and growing.\n\n**How small businesses access capital through digital lending platforms**\n\nPicture this: You need ₹2,00,000 to restock inventory for a seasonal surge. A decade ago, you’d have to convince a bank manager, fill out a threeinch stack of forms, and wait weeks for a “maybe.” Now? You log into your Razorpay dashboard or open CredAble, and a few data points later, you’ve got options. Real ones.\n\nDigital lenders don’t care if your business is three years old or three months in. They look at realtime cash flow, transaction history, even customer reviews. They move faster, approve faster, and deposit faster. And for small businesses, especially those run by women, solopreneurs, or people outside metro areas, that speed can mean the difference between scaling and shutting down.\n\nIt’s not just about getting the loan. It’s about feeling seen by a system that finally understands how modern businesses actually work.\n\n**Realtime payments, virtual cards, and smarter invoicing**\n\nIf you’ve ever waited seven to ten business days for a client payment to clear, you know the rage. It’s 2025. That shouldn’t happen anymore and in most FinTechpowered businesses, it doesn’t.\n\nRealtime payments through UPI, RTP networks, or Payoneer now let you send and receive money instantly, not in laggy chunks. For freelancers, this is gamechanging. For startups, it’s survival.\n\nVirtual cards have also entered the chat. Instead of issuing plastic corporate cards with painful onboarding, companies can now generate virtual ones on the fly. You set spending rules, assign them to team members, and shut them down just as fast. No fraud headaches. No manual audits.\n\nEven invoicing has leveled up. Platforms like Zoho and Tide aren’t just creating slick PDFs, they’re automating reminders, syncing with accounting tools, and showing you which clients are late in realtime. It’s like having a full finance team, but way less annoying.\n\nI remember sending my first automated invoice through RazorpayX. It was 3 a.m., and I was running on anxiety and black coffee. But watching that “Payment Received” notification pop up the next morning? Felt like magic. Like, why didn’t this exist ten years ago?\n\n**Embedded finance: How nonfinancial brands are becoming financial providers**\n\nHere’s something wild: In 2025, you don’t need to be a bank to offer banking services. A fashion ecommerce site can now offer insurance. A food delivery app can give you a line of credit. A ridesharing platform can help drivers save, invest, and even get microloans, all without ever becoming a bank.\n\nThis is called embedded finance, and it’s everywhere. It works because APIs let financial services plug directly into the apps people already use daily. It’s seamless. Invisible, almost. But behind that simplicity is a strategic shift: finance is no longer just an industry. It’s a layer, embedded into every other industry that touches money.\n\nFor users, that means fewer steps, less friction, and more personalization. For businesses, it’s a way to increase loyalty, grow revenue, and actually support their users beyond the transaction.\n\nIt’s not a gimmick. It’s a redefinition of what financial service can look like, tailored, contextual, and shockingly convenient.\n\n**Automating payroll, taxes, and accounting with FinTech tools**\n\nPayroll used to be a monthly stress ritual. You'd gather spreadsheets, pray your math was right, and hope no one got underpaid by mistake. Today, thanks to FinTech tools like Gusto, Khatabook, or Deel, payroll is smart, smooth, and autosynced.\n\nThese platforms calculate taxes, handle compliance, even disburse salaries across borders without anyone needing a degree in finance. For businesses with remote teams, this has been a lifesaver.\n\nAccounting has also changed. Tools like QuickBooks or Vyapar don’t just log numbers, they show you patterns. They nudge you when expenses spike, flag irregularities, and help you budget like a CFO (even if you’ve never taken a finance class).\n\nWhat used to be reactive, “Where did our money go?”, has become proactive: “Here’s where you can save next quarter.”\n\n**Book Insight:** In The Lean Startup (Eric Ries, Chapter 7), Ries talks about building systems that learn. That’s exactly what FinTech tools are doing for business finance, turning spreadsheets into intelligence, and manual grunt work into automated insight. When your tools learn, you get smarter by default.\n\n\n\n# Global Financial Inclusion: FinTech for the Unbanked and Underserved\n\nIf you’ve only ever opened an app to check your bank balance, it’s easy to forget that for billions of people, banking isn’t digital. It’s nonexistent. Entire communities, rural workers, lowincome families, undocumented earners, have lived outside the system for decades. Not because they chose to, but because the system never invited them in.\n\nFinTech is changing that. And not with charity, with access.\n\n**FinTech in emerging economies: Mobile money and microloans**\n\nWalk through any village in Kenya or rural India, and you’ll see something fascinating. No bank branches. But almost everyone has a mobile phone. That tiny device, often a basic smartphone, is now a lifeline to the financial world.\n\nServices like MPesa, Fino PayTech, and Jan Dhan accounts in India have flipped the script. People can now send money to family, pay for school supplies, and access microloans, all from a phone. No credit history? Doesn’t matter. No paperwork? Still works.\n\nMicroloans in particular have rewritten what credit means. A woman in a rural coop can borrow ₹5,000 to start selling pickles in the next village. If she repays, she qualifies for more. It’s smallscale, highimpact finance and it builds real economic independence, especially for women.\n\nThis is FinTech’s most radical promise: that banking doesn’t need a building, and that wealthbuilding can start with a ₹100 loan and a phone signal.\n\n**Can digital wallets and neobanks replace brickandmortar banking?**\n\nThe truth? For millions of people, they already have.\n\nNeobanks like Monzo, Chime, Fi, and Niyo don’t just live online, they were born there. No branches. No lines. No forms that ask you for things you don’t have, like a utility bill in your name or a landline number.\n\nWhat these digitalfirst banks offer is simple: fast onboarding, no minimum balances, and features that actually speak to your daily life. Cashback for food delivery? Sorted. Realtime salary advances? Done. All through apps designed to feel more like WhatsApp than Wells Fargo.\n\nBut it’s not just convenience. It’s trust. When a neobank gives you clear language, quick support, and transparent fees, it builds a kind of confidence that traditional banks rarely offer, especially if you’ve been denied or ignored before.\n\nAnd for people living in remote or underserved areas, this isn’t a tech flex. It’s survival.\n\n**Crowdfunding platforms and democratized investment access**\n\nThink about the last time you saw someone raise money online. Maybe it was a friend crowdfunding for surgery. Or a local business trying to stay open during lockdown. That’s not just generosity, it’s financial decentralization in action.\n\nPlatforms like Kickstarter, Ketto, Republic, and AngelList India have created new ways for regular people to back ideas, products, and causes. You don’t need to be a VC to invest. You just need ₹1,000, an internet connection, and belief.\n\nIn 2025, this kind of grassroots capital raising isn’t niche, it’s mainstream. It’s how indie artists fund albums, how newage brands launch D2C products, how womenled startups bypass gatekeepers who still favor “founders who look the part.”\n\nIt’s also emotional. You’re not just giving money. You’re betting on people. That changes how we relate to finance, from something cold and distant to something communal and deeply human.\n\n**How FinTech supports women, rural communities, and gig workers**\n\nMost legacy finance was built by and for people with stable jobs, fixed incomes, and neatly documented lives. That leaves out a lot of us.\n\nWomen often face more barriers, lower credit access, less financial literacy, and cultural gatekeeping. Rural workers deal with cashonly economies, no banks nearby, and tech that doesn’t speak their language. Gig workers, drivers, designers, delivery folks, earn in bursts, without formal contracts or benefits.\n\nFinTech platforms are stepping in to close those gaps.\n\nApps like SALT and Jai Kisan are offering agriculture loans based on satellite crop data. Financial literacy bots on WhatsApp now teach women about savings and investing in their native dialects. Gig platforms are integrating instant payouts, microinsurance, and retirement savings tools right into their earnings dashboards.\n\nThis isn’t performative. It’s structural. It gives real power to people who’ve always been left at the edge of the financial map.\n\n**Book Insight:** In Invisible Women (Caroline Criado Perez, Chapter 9), there’s a powerful line: “When you don’t collect data on a group of people, it’s a sign you don’t value them.” FinTech, for all its flaws, is finally starting to see the people traditional finance ignored. And that visibility is the first step toward real equity.\n\n\n\n# Regulation, Risk, and Ethical Challenges in FinTech\n\nHere’s the uncomfortable part of the FinTech revolution: just because something is faster and easier doesn’t mean it’s always better, or safer.\n\nYes, FinTech opened doors. But it also opened floodgates. Millions of users are handing over sensitive data, trusting AIdriven systems to make decisions about loans, insurance, and credit, without fully understanding how any of it works. And while regulators are trying to catch up, the truth is… the tech is always two steps ahead.\n\nWe’re in a race between innovation and accountability. And right now, it’s not clear who’s winning.\n\n**How are global regulators keeping up with rapid FinTech innovation?**\n\nThe old rulebook doesn’t work anymore. Most financial regulations were written for physical banks, paper records, and inperson verification. None of that applies to a DeFi protocol or an app built in Estonia being used in Mumbai.\n\nRegulators across the world, from the RBI to the SEC to Singapore’s MAS, are scrambling to create sandboxes, licensing systems, and realtime compliance models. But the speed of innovation is brutal. A FinTech startup can pivot its business model in a week. A government agency might take a year to review a single license application.\n\nThat gap isn’t just bureaucratic, it’s dangerous. Because if no one’s watching the system closely, bad actors slip through. Scams scale. Data leaks. And trust crumbles.\n\nSome regions are doing better than others. India’s UPI framework, for example, is highly regulated and still lightning fast. But globally, the patchwork is uneven and users often don’t know who’s protecting them, or if anyone is at all.\n\n**What is RegTech and how does it reduce compliance friction?**\n\nRegTech sounds like a buzzword, but it’s quietly becoming the most important layer of the FinTech stack. Think of it as compliance on autopilot, software that scans transactions for red flags, flags suspicious behavior, and helps platforms stay within legal lines without slowing down.\n\nIt’s how a FinTech app can onboard thousands of users a day, across different countries, and still meet local KYC laws. It’s also how realtime fraud detection works, using machine learning to block bad actors before damage is done.\n\nBut here’s the twist: when compliance becomes automated, we start to rely on algorithms to make ethical decisions. That brings up a serious question, what happens when those systems get it wrong?\n\n**KYC, AML, and digital identity: How FinTech firms verify users**\n\nIf you’ve ever uploaded a selfie and an ID to open a FinTech account, you’ve met KYC, “Know Your Customer.” It’s the front line of identity verification. AntiMoney Laundering (AML) goes even deeper, using patterns and AI to flag shady behavior.\n\nThese systems are critical. Without them, FinTech becomes a playground for fraud and fake accounts. But they’re also deeply imperfect.\n\nFacial recognition doesn’t work equally across all skin tones. Address verification can fail if you live in a rural area or share a home with multiple families. And if the algorithm decides you look “suspicious”? Good luck getting a human to explain why.\n\nDigital identity in 2025 is a paradox. It’s never been easier to verify someone online and it’s never been easier to get that process completely wrong.\n\n**Is FinTech safe? Ethical risks in algorithmic decisionmaking and bias**\n\nLet’s not sugarcoat it: financial algorithms can be biased. Not because they’re evil, but because they’re trained on messy, historical data. And that data often reflects systemic discrimination, who got loans, who didn’t, who defaulted, who wasn’t even considered.\n\nIf you’re from a marginalized background, your financial footprint might look “risky” to an algorithm. Even if you’ve never missed a payment in your life. That’s not just frustrating. It’s unjust.\n\nThe more FinTech automates decisions, the more urgent it becomes to ask: Who’s building these models? Who’s auditing them? And who do they really serve?\n\nBecause when a bot denies your loan, you can’t argue with it. You just get a notification. And sometimes, that quiet “no” hits harder than anything a banker could say facetoface.\n\n**Protecting user data: Cybersecurity and consumer trust in 2025**\n\nPeople are sharing everything, bank balances, Aadhaar numbers, biometrics, realtime locations, with apps that promise speed and ease. But speed without safety is a trap.\n\nCyberattacks on FinTech platforms are rising. So are phishing scams and synthetic identity frauds. And while toptier companies are investing heavily in encryption and zerotrust architecture, the smaller players? Not always.\n\nConsumers in 2025 are more skeptical than ever. They’ve seen data leaks. They’ve felt what it’s like to lose control of their own information. And they’re starting to demand more than vague “we value your privacy” statements.\n\nTrust is no longer built with branding. It’s built with transparency, clear terms, plainlanguage policies, fast support, and above all, systems that prove they're working for you, not just for profit.\n\n**Book Insight:** In Weapons of Math Destruction (Cathy O’Neil, Chapters 5–6), O’Neil lays out how algorithmic systems, especially in finance, can amplify injustice under the illusion of neutrality. Her warning is clear: when we delegate financial power to machines, we have to be even more vigilant, not less.\n\n\n\n# Future Trends Driving FinTech Innovation\n\nIf the last five years in FinTech felt like a sprint, the next five will feel like a fullon leap. We’re standing at the edge of a new era, where money gets coded into everything, AI becomes your financial copilot, and the idea of “a bank” starts to blur into something unrecognizable.\n\nFinTech isn’t slowing down. It’s mutating, into tools, platforms, ecosystems. And if you want to understand what’s coming next, you need to look beyond apps and accounts. You need to look at what’s happening in code, climate, culture, and quantum.\n\n**The growth of DeFi and tokenization in mainstream financial products**\n\nDeFi, short for decentralized finance, used to be something crypto bros talked about on Discord. Now? It’s quietly rewriting how everything from loans to investing actually works.\n\nAt its core, DeFi removes the middleman. No banks, no brokers, just smart contracts running on public blockchains. That means lending, borrowing, and even earning interest happens through code. No credit checks. No office hours. Just math and software.\n\nIn 2025, DeFi is no longer fringe. Major asset managers are exploring tokenized funds. Real estate platforms are experimenting with fractional ownership using NFTs. And everyday users are accessing investment products that were once locked behind sixfigure income gates.\n\nThe shift here isn’t just technical, it’s philosophical. DeFi asks: what if trust didn’t come from a brand, but from code you could read yourself?\n\nOf course, there’s risk. Protocols get hacked. Values fluctuate. But the idea that financial power can be decentralized, really decentralized, isn’t going away. It’s getting sharper.\n\n**AI in FinTech: From fraud detection to hyperpersonalized finance**\n\nAI used to be a buzzword. Now it’s your financial assistant, your watchdog, your planner and sometimes, your therapist.\n\nIn 2025, AI doesn’t just scan transactions for fraud. It predicts when you might run low on cash next month based on your calendar and spending patterns. It suggests that maybe you should delay that Goa trip, or reminds you your Spotify subscription is due right before rent. And it does it all without making you feel dumb.\n\nHyperpersonalization is where the magic happens. Your financial dashboard doesn’t look like mine. It shows you what you need to know, your goals, your risks, your quirks. That emotional fluency? That’s not an accident. It’s training data.\n\nBut there’s a line. When does help become surveillance? When does guidance turn into control? The best FinTechs are learning to stay on the right side of that line, offering support without stripping autonomy.\n\nI tried an AI budgeting tool last month that nudged me, gently, when I started spending more on food delivery. It didn’t scold me. It just said, “Hey, your takeout spending is trending higher than usual. Want to review your weekly budget?” And weirdly, I did.\n\n**Crossborder payments and stablecoins: Are they replacing SWIFT?**\n\nSending money internationally used to feel like a ritual sacrifice. High fees, unpredictable timelines, and confusing codes made it a nightmare. But now? It’s starting to feel... normal.\n\nThanks to stablecoins, digital currencies pegged to fiat like the USD or INR, crossborder transfers are faster, cheaper, and more transparent than ever. You don’t need a bank in both countries. You don’t need to explain the transfer to five different agents. You just send.\n\nAnd while traditional systems like SWIFT still dominate, their monopoly is cracking. Startups are offering nearinstant crossborder rails using blockchain infrastructure. Even legacy banks are experimenting with stablecoinbased settlement.\n\nThis matters. Because for migrants sending remittances, freelancers working with global clients, or entrepreneurs importing goods, it’s not just about convenience. It’s about dignity. Nobody should lose 10% of their income just because they were born on the wrong side of a border.\n\n**Green FinTech and sustainable investment apps**\n\nHere’s something no one saw coming: finance becoming part of the climate fight.\n\nGreen FinTech is exploding. These are apps and platforms that help you invest in sustainable funds, track your carbon footprint through your purchases, and even round up your payments to support reforestation projects or solar initiatives.\n\nSome let you autodivest from oil companies. Others show your “climate score” based on your spending patterns. It’s not perfect, but it’s giving people a way to align their money with their values, in real time.\n\nIt also pushes companies to change. Because when thousands of users start pulling their money from polluting industries, those industries notice. This isn’t just “ecoaesthetics.” It’s pressure. With numbers behind it.\n\nAnd for Gen Z, who grew up watching the planet burn, this kind of finance isn’t optional. It’s expected.\n\n**Quantum computing in finance: Threat or opportunity for digital security?**\n\nThis is where things get mindbending.\n\nQuantum computing has the potential to break the encryption that keeps most digital finance systems safe. That’s scary. Really scary. But it also opens up new ways to secure data, quantumresistant algorithms, nextgen cryptography, entire protocols designed for a postquantum world.\n\nMost users won’t notice this shift, at least not directly. But behind the scenes, FinTech companies are already racing to futureproof their systems. Because once quantum gets real, everything from passwords to blockchain integrity is on the line.\n\nIt’s a weird paradox. The thing that could destroy modern digital finance might also be the thing that makes it bulletproof.\n\n**Book Insight:** In The Future Is Faster Than You Think (Peter Diamandis, Chapter 10), the authors explain how converging technologies, like AI, quantum, and blockchain, aren’t just stacking. They’re multiplying each other’s impact. That’s exactly what’s happening in FinTech. It’s not one trend. It’s ten, all crashing into each other at once.\n\n\n\n# FAQ: FinTech in 2025, What You Really Want to Know\n\nThe way we use money has changed so fast that most of us are still catching up. If you’ve ever googled “is this FinTech app legit?” or “do I need to know crypto to invest?”, you’re not alone. These are the real questions real people ask, and here are the straightup answers.\n\n**Is FinTech regulated like traditional banks?**\n\nNot always. And that’s both the beauty and the problem.\n\nSome FinTech companies operate under full banking licenses. Others partner with regulated institutions behind the scenes. And a lot of them exist in a kind of legal gray zone, especially in emerging markets or in the DeFi world.\n\nIn India, for example, the RBI has created strict guidelines for digital lenders and wallets, and platforms working with UPI must meet compliance standards. But globally, things are inconsistent. Some countries are ahead. Others haven’t even caught up with mobile payments yet.\n\nSo what does that mean for you? Before trusting a FinTech app with your money, check if they’re licensed, who they partner with, and where they’re based. Look for real reviews, not influencer promos. And if their privacy policy sounds like a riddle? Walk away.\n\n**Can anyone use FinTech apps safely?**\n\nMostly, yes, but you have to be alert. Because here’s the truth: safety in FinTech isn’t just about the platform. It’s about how you use it.\n\nDon’t reuse passwords. Don’t ignore twofactor authentication. Don’t send sensitive documents over WhatsApp because “the agent said it’s fine.” Use verified apps, not clones. Update them regularly. And don’t fall for SMS scams that look almost real.\n\nFinTech can be incredibly secure, often more so than oldschool banks. But the weakest link is still human error. Protect your device, your data, and your decisions.\n\nThink of it like driving a highperformance car. Powerful, yes. But you still need to know how to steer.\n\n**What are examples of FinTech companies in 2025?**\n\nBy now, you’ve probably used at least one of these without even realizing it.\n\nIf you’ve paid with PhonePe, invested on Zerodha, tracked spending with CRED, or got a salary advance through EarnIn, you’ve touched FinTech.\n\nOther major players include Razorpay (business payments), Jar (microinvesting), Groww (mutual funds), Chime (neobank), Wise (international transfers), and Chainalysis (crypto compliance).\n\nThen there are the stealthy ones, the FinTech infrastructure companies you never see, but that power your bank’s “new” app features behind the curtain.\n\nThe point is: FinTech isn’t a niche anymore. It is finance now. Whether it’s flashy or invisible, it’s shaping every swipe, tap, and transfer.\n\n**Will FinTech replace traditional banks entirely?**\n\nNo. But it will force them to reinvent, or risk irrelevance.\n\nBanks still have trust, deep pockets, and regulatory muscle. But they’re losing the UX war. Most Gen Z users would rather text a chatbot than walk into a branch. And when an app can do in 3 seconds what a bank takes 3 days to approve, that gap becomes impossible to ignore.\n\nWhat’s more likely is a merger of strengths. Banks will keep the backend. FinTechs will own the front end. You’ll log into a sleek app, but your money might still sit with a traditional institution underneath.\n\nThe banks that survive won’t be the biggest. They’ll be the ones that partner smart, move fast, and stop treating digital like a “feature.”\n\n**How do I start using FinTech tools as a consumer or business?**\n\nStart simple. Don’t try to overhaul your entire financial life in one weekend.\n\nIf you’re a consumer, download one trusted app to track spending. Or set up a digital wallet if you haven’t already. Use UPI if you're in India, it’s fast, secure, and easy to integrate into daily life. From there, explore investing apps with low minimums, or a budgeting tool that sends you gentle nudges instead of guilt trips.\n\nIf you run a business, look into digital invoicing or payment gateways first.

    "body": "A lot has changed in the three years since [John Cena ](https://www.denofgeek.com/john-cena/)last donned a silly silver helmet to play the hapless hero Peacemaker. That includes the rise of [James Gunn](https://www.denofgeek.com/james-gunn/) to co-head of DC Studios, from which he’s given the universe a fresh reboot, complete [with an all-new take on Superman](https://www.denofgeek.com/movies/superman-review-james-gunn-lost-magic/).\n\nLike any massive shift, the reboot of the DC Universe raises a lot of questions about what is and isn’t canon. But *Peacemaker* co-stars Steve Agee and Jennifer Holland reprised their roles as agents John Economos and Emilia Harcourt in 2022’s [*Black Adam*](https://www.denofgeek.com/black-adam/) and 2023’s [*Shazam! Fury of the Gods*](https://www.denofgeek.com/movies/shazam-fury-of-the-gods-review/), so those movies count, right?\n\nNot so, James Gunn tells *Den of Geek* in no uncertain terms. “They’re not canon! I hate it!” he fumes.\n\nSuch headaches are to be expected when recreating an entire cinematic universe. What’s less expected, however, is the guy who Gunn’s counting on to sort it out. Gunn doesn’t enlist the help of the Man of Steel, but rather the guy whose series has its second season premiere just weeks after Superman flies into the theaters.\n\nThat guy is Peacemaker, a man who loves peace so much, he’s willing to fight for it.\n\n“There are certain things from the old universe that we refer to in *Peacemaker* season 2, but until then, they’re not canon,” Gunn explains. “Almost everything from season 1 is canon, but season 2 will explain everything that is or is not canon.”\n\nThat’s a lot of importance to put on a perennial Z-lister. Created by Joe Gill and Pat Boyette, Christopher Smith a.k.a. Peacemaker made his debut in 1966’s *Fightin’ 5* \\#40, a war comic published by the now defunct Charlton Comics. When DC Comics acquired the Charlton characters in 1983, they gave Peacemaker another shot with a 1988 solo series and a handful of guest appearances before killing him off-panel in 1993. A resurrected and reimagined Chris Smith briefly popped up in 2009 and then disappeared again.\n\nAll of that changed in 2021, when James Gunn made Peacemaker a major part of his debut DC movie, [*The Suicide Squad*](https://www.denofgeek.com/the-suicide-squad/). Even more surprisingly, Gunn cast wrestling superstar and actor John Cena in the role. Gunn then spun Peacemaker off into [his own eight-episode HBO Max series in 2022](https://www.denofgeek.com/peacemaker/), despite the fact that *The Suicide Squad* ended with Chris at death’s door after betraying his team and killing leader Rick Flag (Joel Kinnaman).\n\nNow things are changing again, as Gunn has ascended to co-head of DC Studios and rebooted the DC Universe, a new world that began with the 2024 animated series [*Creature Commandos*](https://www.denofgeek.com/tv/dc-creature-commandos-james-gunn-frank-grillo-alan-tudyk/) and properly kicked off with the much-anticipated [*Superman*](https://www.denofgeek.com/superman/).\n\nImprobably, Peacemaker is at the center of these changes with season 2 of his series arriving on HBO Max on Aug. 21, 2025. *Peacemaker* season 2 puts Chris Smith deep into the new universe, carrying over stories from *Superman* and even clarifying some details about the cosmic reboot.\n\nHow does a low-ranking oddball like Christopher Smith handle the pressure? \n\n# A Big Name for a Super-Nobody\n\nBy 2021, John Cena had built a storied wrestling career, scored multiple blockbuster film appearances, and even cut a couple of singles. Why would someone of his stature sign up to play a character unknown even to most comic fans? \n\n“I wanted to work in the DC universe,” Cena asserts. “The appeal, really, was working with James Gunn. He has a well-documented ‘no asshole’ policy, so I knew I’d be working with people who are friendly and kind and make me better. That right there is a ‘yes’ for me, regardless of the material.”\n\nAt first glance, Cena’s desire to work with the right type of people seems to put him at odds with Christopher Smith, whom the actor describes as “starving to have real human companionship.”\n\nPeacemaker is a jingoistic meathead in *The Suicide Squad*, a mindless killer who becomes a secondary antagonist when his teammates turn against their handler, Amanda Waller (Viola Davis), the duplicitous head of the intelligence agency A.R.G.U.S.\n\nYet, Gunn got no pushback when he offered Cena the part. “I have found that—uniformly— people dream of being a superhero,” Gunn says. “There’s never been a person that I’ve dealt with who was not extraordinarily excited about their costume.”\n\nIt also helps that Gunn tells complex stories about seemingly silly characters. “Whether dealing with Rocket Raccoon or Superman or Peacemaker, I start with the question, ‘What if this character were real? What would bring them to the place where they are today?’” These questions inform everything from personal motivations to costume choices.\n\n“Superman is an alien from outer space who wants kids and people to like him. That’s why he wears the suit,” Gunn observes. “Peacemaker wants to be cool and instill fear in people, but he’s kind of an idiot.“Peacemaker might instill fear because he looks like John Cena, but I don’t think that costume’s instilling fear in anyone.”\n\nWhatever Gunn’s description might suggest, Chris Smith does get some self-awareness throughout *Peacemaker*. “When he eliminates his friend and mentor Rick Flag in a quest for peace, Chris realizes that his definition of ‘peace’ has been vague and fragmented and flawed,” Cena acknowledges.\n\n*Peacemaker*’s first season puts Chris on Project Butterfly, a minor assignment that gains importance when the alien butterflies he investigates invade Earth. Along the way, Peacemaker confronts his father, Auggie (Robert Patrick), who leads a white supremacist terror cell as the armored White Dragon and blames Chris for the death of beloved older son Keith (Liam Hughes).\n\nFrom these revelations, Chris Smith seems less like a thug and more like a man suffering from toxic masculinity. Although reluctant to ascribe one specific meaning to his character’s condition—“audiences can take away whatever they want,” he insists—Cena sees these revelations as the character’s main appeal. \n\n“Chris has regrets about what he did to Rick Flag and has a lot of troubles at home. An eagle is his best friend; I think that says a lot,” he chuckles. “Eagly \\[Peacemaker’s CGI-rendered avian sidekick\\] is awesome, he’s a superstar, but Chris really has very few human companions. The people who want to be his friend, like Vigilante \\[Freddie Stroma\\], he pushes aside or acts like he’s better than.”\n\nAnd yet, by the end of season 1, Peacemaker has stopped the invasion and faced down his father. More importantly, Christopher Smith has finally made friends, real human friends. And they’re just as messed up as he is.\n\n# Shakeup on 11th Street\n\nIn the first teaser for *Peacemaker* season 2, Chris Smith arrives at a secret location for an interview. Across from him sits billionaire benefactor Maxwell Lord (Sean Gunn), flanked by two members of the Justice Gang, Hawkgirl (Isabela Merced) and the Green Lantern Guy Gardner (Nathan Fillion). As seen in *Superman*, the Justice Gang are the most important superhero team in the universe. And, having just saved the world from alien butterflies, Peacemaker is ready to join their ranks.\n\nBut when a tech error allows Smith to hear all of their snide comments, including Lord’s assessment that “this guy sucks,” Chris storms out of the building, his dignity in shambles.\n\nNobody’s surprised that Peacemaker wouldn’t be welcomed by those who rub shoulders with the Man of Steel, not even Cena. “He was put on the Suicide Squad, and they’re not necessarily our best and brightest,” he points out, “but now he wants to make it to the big leagues.”\n\nWhat is surprising, however, is that Chris finds comfort from Leota Adebayo, daughter of Amanda Waller. \n\nThroughout the first season of *Peacemaker*, Adebayo was a reluctant participant in Project Butterfly, pushed into service by her mother and told to betray Chris. But in season 2, Adebayo and Chris have a very different relationship.\n\n“These two definitely love each other,” says Danielle Brooks, Adebayo’s Oscar and Tony-nominated performer. “They’re both fighting for the love of their parents, the people who raised them and left them kind of awkward.”\n\nIt might be that awkwardness that helps Chris and Adebayo bond not only with one another, but also with the other weirdos in the show, which include not just Vigilante, but also fellow A.R.G.U.S. agents Emilia Harcourt and John Economos. After some initial bumps, Chris and his friends finally connected over their mission against the butterflies and their love of hard rock music, calling themselves “the 11th Street Kids,” after the 1984 track by Finnish band Hanoi Rocks.\n\nAt the start of *Peacemaker*’s second season, the Kids have fragmented, due in part to Adebayo’s decision to reveal her mother’s actions to the rest of the world at the end of the season. \n\nJohn Economos is back on familiar ground, working for Waller. “I’m back at A.R.G.U.S., back on computers doing my usual shit,” chuckles comedian Steve Agee, who has been playing Economos since *The Suicide Squad*. But familiarity does not mean life is better for the sad-sack nerd, last seen in *Creature Commandos*. “I don’t think Economos has ever been comfortable. He’s kind of been beaten down by life. He’s had a lot of jobs that haven’t been super pleasant, dealing with a lot of people who haven’t been super pleasant.”\n\nAccording to co-star Jennifer Holland, things aren’t too much better for her character, the capable but cold Emilia Harcourt. “She’s in a worse place than she was in season 1. She lost her job after Adebayo’s leaks, and she’s desperate. Her whole life has been spent as a soldier, so she doesn’t have a whole lot of close personal relationships.”\n\nOf course, a lack of personal relationships is the founding ethos of the 11th Street Kids, and it’s that desire for connection that binds the group together. Even Adebayo’s decision to reveal Waller to the world was an attempt to bond with them.\n\n“Leaking information about Waller was Adebayo being a team player,” explains Brooks. “She finally understood what it was to be part of something and to be loyal. Adebayo wanted to do the right thing and stand with the team that’s been standing with her. She showed her mother and the team whose side she was really on.”\n\nSuch declarations of loyalty may be enough to get Harcourt to forgive Adebayo, but it’s not going to make things any easier for the one-time agent.\n\n“A lot of the characters have shifted in different ways,” Holland points out. “At first, Adebayo was the new girl and Harcourt was capable professional and Peacemaker was the emotionally fucked-up buffoon. Peacemaker has grown since season 1, and Harcourt has regressed in a lot of ways.”\n\nWhatever growth the characters have experienced, they can’t escape their past demons. In Chris’s case, those demons include the new head of A.R.G.U.S., Rick Flag Sr., who uses his position to get revenge against the man who killed his son.\n\n“I’m the heavy,” says action veteran Frank Grillo, who reprises his role as Rick Flag Sr. from *Creature Commandos* and *Superman*. “Flag sees metahumans as aliens. They’re beings who need to be controlled because it’s easy for them to get out of control. Cena’s character is the hero, regardless of his behavior, but as far as Rick Flag is concerned, Peacemaker’s a bad guy.”\n\nAs if cutting a wrestling promo, Grillo starts to laugh. “Peacemaker’s gotta go, he’s gotta feel the wrath.”\n\n# Four-Color Heroes in Shades of Gray\n\nSo is Peacemaker the hero and Flag the villain? Or is it the other way around? Moral compasses aren’t so clear in *Peacemaker*, and that’s all part of Gunn’s design.\n\n“In the DCU in general, we’re finding shades of gray in people’s morality,” says Gunn. “That’s even with Superman, who’s as good as you can get, or the Justice Gang, who are heroes, but they’re corporate tools. It’s never a black and white thing.\n\n“And then there’s Peacemaker, an incredibly complex and conflicted individual who has done a lot of incredibly bad things. But even he has a sensitivity that’s been bashed down by his father and society.”\n\nIt certainly helps that Cena comes to the role with what he calls “a hardened shell,” developed through years in the ring. “The live wrestling audience is enthusiastic and at points relentless. The crowd will sing my theme song at the top of their lungs and will scream that I suck,” he says. That devotion to the part impresses his on-screen nemesis Grillo, who allows, “My hat’s off to John Cena because the way he plays Chris, you can’t help but love him.”\n\nThe respect that Cena and Grillo can show one another comes in part from their long history working in action entertainment. That background also prepares the actors for some intense fight sequences for *Peacemaker*’s second season.\n\n“I’m mostly contained, but I have one big fight scene with Cena. It’s fun and brutal,” teases Grillo, before pointing to another castmate whose physical prowess impressed him. “Jennifer Holland’s fight stuff is phenomenal!” he enthuses.\n\nWhile thrilled with the end result of Harcourt’s massive episode one rumble, she’s quick to point out that it didn’t come to her easily. “I couldn’t have done it without my stunt double, C.C. Ice. She tirelessly trained with me,” Holland admits. “All the stunt actors in that scene with me were training in the gym for weeks to get it right.”\n\nIn fact, all of the 11th Street Kids get their big moments in season 2… whether they want to or not.\n\n“John Economos is a reluctant hero,” laughs Agee. “Pretty much everything he does is against his better judgment. He’s very much like me. Honestly, though, I would be super stoked if I saved some people’s lives by killing a monster gorilla,” referring to Economos’s moment of gory heroism in the first season. “I would be so jazzed.”\n\n# Do You Really Wanna Taste It?\n\nAs a show about superheroes and alien invaders, *Peacemaker* has to nail the action scenes. But the cast found another, very different physical aspect of the show even more challenging. And, in a way, more important. “We really had to get the opening dance number dialed in,” reveals Grillo. “James was very serious about it.”\n\nEvery episode of *Peacemaker* season 1 opened with the entire cast, in costume, dancing to “Do You Wanna Taste It” by Norwegian glam metal band Wig Wam. The song turned out to be a viral hit, inspiring hundreds of imitators on social media. For season 2, *Peacemaker*’s dialing things up with a new song, new moves, and a much bigger cast.\n\n“There are so many more people in the cast. Tim Meadows and Frank Grillo and Sol Rodríguez and David Denman. There are so many people,” says Agee with some awe. “It’s a huge dance number, oh my god.”\n\nEven Brooks, who comes to the show with a theater degree from Juilliard (a credit she puts into perspective by noting that “Juilliard really can’t prepare you for falling out of a giant alien cow”), found the sequence challenging. “You know when you have to pat your head and rub your stomach at the same time? That’s what it felt like,” she jokes. “But once it clicks in the body and everybody is doing it all together, it really, really works.”\n\n“You’ve got this crazy cast of people who are totally one hundred percent in on this journey, and we’re doing this weird dance, and everyone is just ego aside,” adds Holland. “You see someone like Tim Meadows really wanting to get it right, and it’s a really special experience.”\n\n“The first time I saw the dance number, I was smiling ear to ear,” Agee concludes. “People are going to love it.”\n\nClearly, the change in the opening credits is a big deal, one that’s sure to draw a lot of attention to *Peacemaker* season 2. But there’s another change that Peacemaker needs to deal with in season 2: a reboot of the entire DC Universe.\n\n# A New Universe\n\nOn one hand, Gunn has a simple explanation for those who don’t understand the status of past stories in the new universe. “Nothing is canon before *Creature Commandos*, but you can think of those other things as vague memories of things that happened, going back even to the first *Suicide Squad.*”\n\nOn the other hand, Gunn also knows that these issues come with the territory. “There are going to be mistakes when you’re building a world as large as these ones are, whether it’s Game of Thrones, Star Wars, DC or Marvel. It’s going to be complicated, you know?”\n\nThat’s certainly true of the DC Universe, which has already been rebooted in the world of comics multiple times since 1985. As a longtime comic book fan himself, Gunn can roll with the changes.\n\n“I’m a balanced canon guy,” he observes. “On the one hand, people take it a little too far. Obviously, these are fictional stories, so we don’t have to pretend that they’re reality. But at the same time, these stories are supposed to be in the same world, and you need to pay attention to the connection between things.”\n\nSuch complications are worth it, especially for someone like Gunn, who gets to fill the universe with oddballs from the comics, even if he can’t get them all on the screen yet. “The Legion of Super-Heroes is a difficult thing to bring to life,” he says of DC’s long-running series about 31st-century teenagers, and he hasn’t yet figured out how to adapt his personal favorite, the magical imp known as Bat-Mite.\n\n“I would love to be able to figure out a way to do Bat-Mite, or at least Peace-Mite, because I’m sure there’s an imp somewhere in the Ninth Dimension who worships Peacemaker. In fact, we see some imps in season 2 of *Peacemaker*.”\n\nClearly, Gunn isn’t done with the weirdos of the DC Universe, and that’s good news for Chris Smith. In fact, to hear Cena tell it, nothing can hold back Peacemaker, not even Gunn’s own rules.\n\n“James Gunn made a sacred oath that he’s not bringing characters back from the dead, and he already broke that by bringing Peacemaker back after he died in *The Suicide Squad*,” teases Cena. “So I can confidently say that the future of Peacemaker is one that will defy the odds.”\n\nThat’s perfectly said, because when you’re talking about guys like Christopher Smith, “odd” is definitely the word.",

    "body": "# From the Enslaved to the Empress\n\n\n\nliterieJul 21 2025\n\n# Chapter 1 Three Years' Punishment\n\n\"I'm warning you one last time—keep your mouth shut when you leave. Whatever happened in the past three years, bury it and forget it, got it? Don't think being the daughter of duke's estate means someone's going to back you up!\"\n\n\"There never was anyone before, and there sure won't be in the future.\" Athena Monson's face was expressionless, her voice hollow. She nodded meekly, not daring to defy the steward.\n\nLeaning against the wall for support, she slowly made her way out of the camp.\n\nShe had once lit up Pidence City with her dazzling dance. Now her knees, ruined from years of injury, could barely hold her weight. Without medicine, even her skill in healing was useless.\n\nJust outside the camp, she heard someone call her name. Flinching, she lifted her head hesitantly.\n\nWhat met her eyes was a majestic steed, a royal gift, and astride it sat the Marquis of Somers—Michael Osborne. The famed war god himself.\n\nHe sat tall and poised, broad shoulders tapering to a lean waist, his face strikingly handsome. He still carried that same air of noble elegance.\n\nThis was the man she had loved for three long years. She had seen this scene in her dreams countless times—him finally coming to take her home.\n\nHer eyes filled with tears, and she opened her mouth to speak, but no words came.\n\nBecause it was him—he was the one who had thrown her into this hellish camp, ordering others to \"teach her a lesson.\"\n\nThe cold indifference in his eyes made her already shattered heart tremble again.\n\n\"I can take you home,\" Michael said, looking down at her from his horse, eyes like ice, his tone as sharp as a blade. \"But tell me—do you finally admit you were wrong?\n\n\"If you hadn't poisoned the pastries back then, Willow wouldn't be living with a chronic illness. She still needs daily medicine. You only suffered three years of punishment—she'll suffer for the rest of her life. You owe her forever!\"\n\nWhen Athena remained silent, Michael snapped, \"Answer me! Do you admit your guilt?\"\n\nThe sudden sharpness in his voice made her jump. Reflexively, she shut her eyes, wrapped her arms around her head, and crouched down, crying out, \"I admit it! I was wrong! I'll never do it again!\"\n\nBut the lash she expected never came. Only then did she remember—he was the Marquis of Somers. A man like him would never lower himself to beat someone like her.\n\nStill, she truly had been wrong. She was wrong to care. Wrong to love. Wrong to give her heart to people who treated it like nothing.\n\nWhen she'd first been thrown into the camp, she still clung to a shred of hope.\n\nShe had thought, 'My fiancé can't really be that heartless. He has protected me since our engagement—risking his life, even, to spare me from harm.\n\n'And my parents in the duke's estate—surely, they would come for me. I have been framed.'\n\nBut she waited. And waited. And what came instead was nothing but torment—merciless, day after day, at the hands of the soldiers.\n\nShe was a noblewoman, not a camp whore. They didn't dare touch her, which only made them more creative in how they broke her.\n\nSometimes, they beat her with slender whips made specifically for disciplining women—tools that cut deep and left her flesh in tatters. Other times, they stripped her naked and tossed her into the snow.\n\nThey were waiting for her to beg. To give in. To offer her body in exchange for a bite of food or a few days of peace.\n\nBut she never did. So their torment grew nastier, more degrading, every time.\n\nEventually, she stopped fighting back—not out of obedience, but because she no longer had the strength to resist.\n\n\"Athena, what game are you playing now?\" Michael frowned, his tone sharp with disdain.\n\nHe wondered, 'Three years of discipline, and she's ended up this pathetic?'\n\nThe once-glowing beauty of her face was gone—now it was sickly pale and hollow. Her waist, once soft and full, had thinned so much it looked like it might snap under a strong breeze.\n\nHe thought, 'Trying to act pitiful? I am not falling for it. I personally ordered my men to take good care of her. There is no way she's truly been mistreated.'\n\nTurning away, Michael dismounted. He reached out a hand toward her. \"Get in the carriage.\"\n\nBut she recoiled like a wounded animal, clutching her head, eyes blank, voice trembling as she pleaded, \"No… please don't… don't touch me…\"\n\n\"That's enough,\" he snapped. \"Still pretending to be pitiful?\"\n\nHis voice turned colder. \"What, is this your way of making me feel guilty?\"\n\nAthena slowly came back to herself. Her voice was dry, hoarse. She gave a hollow laugh, laced with self-mockery.\n\nIn front of Michael—or her parents—she had never once had the right to feel wronged.\n\nIf they'd ever truly felt guilty, they wouldn't have waited until now.\n\nThirteen years ago, her birth parents finally brought her home to the duke's estate. That was when she found out the truth—she'd been swapped at birth.\n\nThe greedy couple who raised her had traded her away and left her to suffer five bitter years.\n\nShe'd thought that returning to her real family meant love and acceptance. But what she got instead was coldness.\n\nHer parents and brothers barely looked at her.\n\nWhenever Willow Monson—the girl who'd lived her life—felt sad or neglected, they rushed to comfort her, as if she were the real daughter.\n\nLittle by little, Athena was pushed aside.\n\nThey constantly reminded her, \"You're the older sister. You should be the mature one. Be patient with Willow. Don't fight. Don't compete.\"\n\nWanting so desperately to belong, Athena did as she was told. She gave way in everything, always stepping aside for Willow.\n\nThree years ago, she even made pastries by hand to try to please her.\n\nBut Willow ended up poisoned—vomiting blood.\n\nTheir parents were furious. They said Athena's years away had corrupted her to the bone. Said she wasn't worthy of being their daughter.\n\nEgged on by Willow's whispers, they decided to send her away—banished from Pidence City forever.\n\nEven the brothers who once adored her said, \"Willow might've enjoyed your life for over a decade, but she's innocent. How could you use such cruel tactics just to win attention? We don't have a sister as heartless as you!\"\n\nNo matter how Athena tried to explain, no one believed her. Not once.\n\nThe moment Willow shed a tear, the blame fell on Athena.\n\nIn the end, it was Michael who stepped in to stop them from sending her away.\n\nBut he didn't save her. He simply had her quietly dumped in the military camp—believing that after enough suffering, she'd finally learn her place.\n\nA gust of wind lifted the tangled strands of Athena's hair, revealing her emaciated, unrecognizable face.\n\nMichael scowled. \"Get up. We're going back to the estate.\"\n\nAthena tried, but her legs gave out beneath her, and she crumpled to the ground again.\n\nMichael turned back, his eyes flashing cold steel. \"If you'd rather not go back… then drag yourself back into that camp.\"\n\n# Chapter 2 Realize Your Mistake?\n\nAthena lowered her gaze, gritted her teeth, and forced herself to stand. She didn't say a word as she clumsily climbed into the carriage, using both hands and knees.\n\nHer legs throbbed with pain, barely able to hold her, and she looked completely wretched.\n\nMichael turned away, refusing to watch. He had assumed three years of punishment would be enough to wear down her spirit, but the moment they met again, she was already trying to play the victim—putting on a show to win his sympathy.\n\nIf it hadn't been for that person's orders, he wouldn't have come for her at all.\n\nWhat baffled him was why someone of such high rank would even notice Athena—let alone give an order about her the moment he returned to Pidence City.\n\nMichael was the first to get out of the carriage. Without a glance back, he instructed his men, \"I have business back at camp. After you drop her off, get rid of the carriage—I don't want to see it again. It's filthy.\"\n\nFilthy. The word hit her like a slap. Athena's chest ached with a dull, sinking pain. She sniffed quietly, face devoid of emotion, and stepped down from the carriage.\n\nOutside the towering red gates of the duke's estate, a woman was already waiting. The moment she saw Athena, she rushed over, eyes full of urgency.\n\nBut the first thing she said was, \"My sweet daughter, it's been three years. Have you finally realized your mistake?\"\n\n\"I have,\" Athena replied flatly.\n\nHer mistake had been wanting love too much. This time, she would sever those ties—for good. Just… not yet. Not while Margaret Monson, her grandmother, still needed her care.\n\nEloise Monson looked at Athena, her daughter—so thin and pale, her eyes distant—and her expression faltered.\n\nThree years of hardship had changed Athena completely. Just one look was enough to make her heart ache.\n\nNo matter how deeply Athena had erred, she was still her daughter—still her flesh and blood. And she had clearly paid the price.\n\n\"It's good you understand now,\" Eloise said softly. \"You mustn't be so willful again. Come on, get up.\" She reached out to help.\n\nBut Athena immediately stood up on her own and took a step back, putting distance between them. Her eyes were guarded, cautious.\n\nEloise's heart twisted. \"You blame me for being too harsh? But I did it for your own good—for your future! What mother doesn't want the best for her child?\"\n\nHer eyes turned red, her voice trembling with a hint of tears. \"Don't hold it against me…\"\n\nHer face was full of sorrow, as though she were the one who'd suffered for three years.\n\nAthena stood there, unmoved, making no effort to bridge the gap between them.\n\nJust then, a slender figure stepped gracefully out of the manor and gently supported Eloise's arm.\n\n\"Mother, Athena's just come home. She's probably overwhelmed. Don't be upset if she seems distant—give her a little time, all right?\"\n\nThe girl was delicate and fair, with porcelain skin and a sweet, innocent smile.\n\nShe turned to Athena and extended her hand, her eyes wide with sincerity. \"Athena, I don't hold anything against you. Let's forget the past, okay? We're still family—we should love each other, just like before.\"\n\nHer smile was as gentle and harmless as ever.\n\nAthena almost laughed out loud. After everything she'd endured, she wondered, 'Do they really think a few nice words can just wipe it all away?'\n\n\"Love? Between you and me?\" Disgust flickered in her eyes.\n\nThat was when someone finally lost patience.\n\n\"Willow's already gone out of her way to be kind to you, and you're still acting like this? What's wrong with your attitude?\"\n\nNicolas Monson had just come from court, still in his crimson official robes. He swung off his horse and walked over, clearly irritated.\n\n\"You think you're the only one who's suffered these past three years? Do you have any idea what Mother's been through? She's lost sleep night after night, her hair's turning white!\n\n\"If it weren't for Willow taking care of her and fulfilling your duties, who knows what would've happened?\"\n\nNicolas had seen the whole scene earlier—Eloise's joy quickly deflated, Willow's soft voice met with Athena's cold rejection.\n\nNicolas thought, 'And all because of three years of punishment? What right does she have to act wronged? Willow almost died.'\n\nEloise frowned at Nicolas, her son, clearly disapproving. \"Don't exaggerate. She just got back. As her big brother, you should be gentler with her. Don't scare her.\"\n\n\"Mother, you don't need to defend her. The Monson family owes her nothing. She's the one who made the mistake. And because of her, our entire household's reputation suffered.\n\n\"Everyone in Pidence City knows the Duke's family raised a vicious, manipulative girl. And Willow? She never complained—she's done everything she could to protect this family.\"\n\nNicolas still hadn't calmed down.\n\n\"Athena! Willow even covered for you—she told everyone you never poisoned her, just to protect your name. Shouldn't you be grateful?\" he continued.\n\nWhen Athena said nothing, his voice rose sharply. \"Say something! Are you mute now?\"\n\nAthena blinked, struggling to hold back the sting in her eyes.\n\nOnce upon a time, Nicolas had been different. Unlike her second and third brothers, he had been the one who truly cared for her.\n\nHe once told her he'd split the love he gave Willow and give half to her—and for a while, he meant it.\n\nWhen the servants looked down on her, he gave out thirty lashes on her behalf. On her birthday, he carved a jewel pendant for her by hand. When she was sick, he stayed by her side through the night.\n\nBut all that kindness vanished the moment Willow acted hurt.\n\nLove that could be so easily withdrawn—that kind of love, she no longer wanted.\n\nThe air between them turned stiff with silence.\n\nEloise quickly stepped in to smooth things over. \"What's done is done. Let's go inside—your father and grandmother are still waiting.\"\n\nNicolas scoffed and gave a dismissive wave of his sleeve as he turned toward the estate.\n\nAfter a few steps, he looked back, his voice suddenly soft. \"Willow, come here.\"\n\n\"Yes, Nicolas.\" She smiled sweetly, casting a glance at Athena. She said nothing—but somehow, it said everything.\n\nAthena was used to it by now. She had always been the outsider in this family.\n\nShe had already made up her mind: she would let go. Let Willow have all of it—Michael, her parents, her brothers.\n\nBut even with that resolve, watching this unfold still made her throat tighten and her eyes sting.\n\n# Chapter 3 Oversized Clothes\n\nEloise led Athena through the gates of the estate, turning to the servants as they entered. \"Take Lady Athena to wash up first. After that, she'll go pay her respects to Lady Margaret.\"\n\nThen she looked at Athena with a gentle smile. \"Your grandmother's getting on in years. Her health hasn't been great—she's been relying on herbal tonics these past few years. When you see her, be sweet and respectful, and don't bring up anything about the last three years. It'll only upset her.\"\n\nAthena nodded quietly.\n\nMargaret had always been the most fair-minded person in the family—but she was too old now to involve herself in household affairs.\n\nSeeing Athena accept her words without protest, Eloise finally relaxed a little.\n\nShe continued, testing the waters, \"You're eighteen now—of marriageable age. What happened in the camp... let's not mention it again. If word gets out that you spent the last three years living among soldiers, day and night, people will start talking.\n\n\"That kind of gossip could ruin your chances of a good match. I've already come up with an explanation. We'll say you were away recuperating, and now you've just returned.\"\n\nAthena's face remained calm. She gave a soft \"Yes,\" then followed the maid assigned to her.\n\nBut after a few turns, she realized something was wrong. This wasn't the way to her old courtyard.\n\nShe asked, and the maid smiled brightly as she explained, \"Lady Willow has been in poor health for years. The doctor said the trees in your courtyard were too damp and affected her health. So they were all cut down.\n\n\"To help her recover, they leveled your courtyard and merged it with hers. They even diverted hot spring water to the new space for her treatment. But don't worry, Lady Eloise had this new courtyard cleaned and prepared for you before your return.\"\n\nThe maid said it as if it were completely normal, perfectly reasonable.\n\nAs if everyone had conveniently forgotten that Athena was the true daughter of the house—while Willow was merely adopted.\n\nThe maid led Athena to a small, modest courtyard and pushed the door open. \"You'll be staying here from now on, Lady Athena.\"\n\nThe space was much smaller than her original quarters, and with no greenery in sight, it looked bare and lifeless.\n\nTwo unfamiliar maids stepped forward and bowed. \"Lady Athena.\"\n\nAthena didn't recognize either of them. After three years away, most of the household staff had changed.\n\nOne had a round face, the other an oval one. Both were attractive and sharp-eyed—clearly selected for looks and cleverness.\n\n\"I'm Siena Hotham.\"\n\n\"I'm Aliza Crofton.\"\n\nTogether, they echoed, \"Hi, Lady Athena.\"\n\nAthena gave a small nod and motioned for them to rise.\n\nThen she asked, \"Where are Thalia and Macy?\"\n\nThose had been her personal maids before she was sent away. But once she entered the military camp, all news of them vanished.\n\nThe maid smiled and replied, \"Not long after you left, they both got married. I imagine they're living quiet, peaceful lives now—looking after their husbands and raising children.\"\n\nAthena nodded. A peaceful life sounded good. Far better than serving others for the rest of your days.\n\nThe thought brought a faint sense of ease. She stepped inside.\n\nThe table was already set. The meal was generous—four dishes and a soup—but the plates were no bigger than a clenched fist.\n\nShe began to eat. One plate of pasta disappeared in just a few bites.\n\nHer brows knit slightly. \"Is there more?\"\n\nSiena looked momentarily stunned, then quickly nodded. \"Yes, of course, I'll get it right away.\"\n\nWatching her eat so fast, Aliza spoke up gently, \"Lady Athena, please slow down. You'll upset your stomach if you rush like that.\"\n\nAthena's fork paused in mid-air. She had nearly forgotten—this wasn't the military camp anymore.\n\nThis was the duke's estate. No one here was going to snatch her food. No one would dump kitchen slop onto her plate.\n\nThe pasta was fragrant. The dishes were fresh. And the meat—it was real bacon. Not rat. Not snake.\n\nSiena returned with two more plates of pasta.\n\nAthena ate quickly and without grace. There was nothing delicate or refined in her manners—she looked more like a starving beggar than a noble daughter.\n\nSiena opened her mouth several times to speak but held her tongue each time.\n\nAfter the meal, the servants had already prepared hot water for her bath. Siena and Aliza followed her in. \"Lady Athena, allow us to help you bathe,\" Siena offered politely.\n\n\"That won't be necessary. You can leave.\" Athena said.\n\nSiena hesitated, clearly unsure.\n\nAliza added with concern, \"If Lady Eloise finds out, she'll punish us for not serving you properly…\"\n\nAthena didn't speak. She simply looked at them—calm, expressionless.\n\nThere was no anger in her eyes, no emotion at all. But the chill behind that blank gaze made both girls shiver.\n\nWithout another word, they backed out of the room and quietly closed the door behind them.\n\nOnly then did Athena step behind the screen and begin undressing.\n\nHer body was gaunt, skin stretched tightly over bone. Her once-fair skin was now covered in bruises—some new, others long faded.\n\nIf she hadn't known medicine, she would have died in that place.\n\nAfter washing, she reached for the fresh clothes laid out on the rack. The fabric was fine—soft, warm, and tailored to fit.\n\nBut on her starved frame, the robe hung loose and shapeless, making her look more like a walking skeleton than a noble daughter.\n\n\"Lady Athena, Lady Eloise and the Lady Margaret are waiting,\" Aliza reminded her from outside.\n\nAthena nodded and made her way toward Starling House.\n\nIn just three years, the duke's estate had changed so much.\n\nShe paused at the edge of the pond, lost in thought. \"What happened to the lotuses?\" she asked.\n\n\"Lady Willow said there were too many mosquitoes in summer,\" Aliza replied. \"So Lord Nicolas had them all removed.\"\n\nAthena thought, 'Of course. Willow—again.' Athena felt a familiar ache in her chest.\n\nWhen she had first arrived at the estate, she tried so hard to win everyone over.\n\nShe had planted those lotuses herself, hoping to make wine from the blossoms and gift it to Nicolas.\n\nHe had laughed at her back then. \"You're my sister. There's no need for all that. But if it makes you happy, I'll help you plant them.\"\n\nThe proud, aloof heir of the house had actually gotten his hands dirty—for her.\n\nAt the time, Athena had thought, 'So this is what it feels like to be cherished.'\n\nBut now… it was clear. Whatever kindness they'd shown her didn't come close to how they treated Willow. Not even a tenth of it.\n\nShe arrived at Margaret's quarters. The room was already full.\n\nEloise looked toward the door—and frowned. She wondered, 'Why does the robe look so oversized on Athena?'\n\n# Chapter 4 The One To Blame\n\nBefore Athena could say a word, Nicolas stepped forward, blocking Margaret's view.\n\n\"Athena! Are you doing this on purpose?\" he snapped. \"Three years weren't enough to teach you some manners? Still playing your little games? You've really let me down!\"\n\n\"I told you to present yourself properly. What are you wearing?\" His expression was full of disapproval, his tone unconsciously laced with the stern authority of a Justice Ministry official.\n\nHe looked at her like she was standing trial. \"If you've got complaints, direct them at me. Why come here and put on a show in front of Grandmother? Are you trying to make her feel sorry for you? Do you want to upset her so badly she falls ill?\"\n\nAthena almost laughed out loud.\n\nShe raised an eyebrow, her smile cool and detached. \"The clothes? Lady Eloise picked them out. What did you expect me to wear—what I came back in from the military camp?\"\n\nThat shut him up. For a moment, Nicolas was at a loss. She had called Eloise \"Lady Eloise\"—not \"Mother.\"\n\nOnly then did it hit him: ever since Athena returned, she hadn't regarded him as brother once either.\n\nA flicker of unease crept into his chest. The harsh words caught in his throat and never made it out.\n\nHis gaze narrowed, a thought nagging at the back of his mind. 'It's only been three years… how did she waste away like this?'\n\nEloise quickly stepped in to smooth things over. \"That was my oversight. Don't be too hard on Athena.\"\n\nNicolas stepped aside, allowing Athena to enter.\n\nMargaret's eyes lit up the moment she saw her.\n\n\"Come here, come,\" she called, voice trembling slightly. \"Let me take a good look at you.\"\n\nThat warmth, that longing in her eyes—Athena felt her nose sting. She stepped forward and let Margaret take her hands and look her over from head to toe.\n\n\"How did you get so thin?\" Margaret pulled her into a hug, holding her tightly, voice choked with emotion. \"My sweet girl… you've suffered. It's all my fault. I'm too old, too useless… I couldn't protect you…\"\n\nAthena knew how things had gone. Back then, Margaret had stood by her, even if it meant alienating the rest of the family. Her health had already been fragile.\n\nThe fact she'd made it through these years at all was a miracle. If not for the empire's strict laws, no one knew what would've happened…\n\nShe wrapped her arms around Margaret, and whispered through a tight throat, \"Grandmother.\"\n\nJust one word—and Margaret broke down completely, tears streaming down her face.\n\nOff to the side, Eloise watched the reunion, a pang of bitterness tightening in her chest.\n\nAthena had been home for some time now… and still hadn't called her \"Mother.\"\n\nShe dabbed at her eyes with a silk handkerchief, playing the part of the grieving parent.\n\nWillow stepped up, gently hugging her. \"Don't be sad, Mother. Athena's home now.\" Her voice was soft, comforting, obedient.\n\nEloise looked down at her beloved Willow and felt deeply comforted.\n\nShe nodded, eyes still wet, but a faint smile tugging at her lips. She thought, 'At least Willow understands.'\n\nBut just as she started to feel at ease, that smile froze.\n\nMargaret's voice, quivering and confused, rang out, \"What's going on?\"\n\nAthena's once delicate fingers were now covered in scars—blackened bruises and jagged welts. When she lifted her sleeve, old knife wounds and fresh burns marred the skin along her arms.\n\nMargaret's gaze faltered. She couldn't bear to look any longer. \"She was sent to do labor… how did she end up like this?\"\n\nEloise looked genuinely shocked. \"These injuries—how did they happen?\"\n\nSurrounded by concerned faces, Athena buried the emptiness in her eyes and replied softly, \"They came from the overseers at the camp, of course…\"\n\nGasps rippled through the room. Athena's lips curled into a faint, mocking smile. \"I was there to work, not to be treated like a young lady. Getting beaten was just part of the routine.\"\n\nShe didn't say more. Even recalling it made her stomach turn.\n\nBut her few words had already shaken everyone to the core. They thought, 'Beaten—for three full years. How has she even survived?'\n\nMargaret's hands trembled as she clutched Athena's. \"How could they? How dare they? You're the duke's daughter! That camp was under your fiancé's command—how could anyone there lay a finger on you?\"\n\nAthena's smile grew, cold and biting. \"Because someone gave the order.\"\n\nNicolas's face turned red with fury. \"You really are useless. You let them beat you like that and didn't even fight back?\"\n\nAthena's voice stayed flat, almost detached. \"Do you think a place like that gave me the right to speak, let alone resist? Being quiet and obedient meant fewer beatings. That's the reality.\"\n\nShe looked directly at him, that faint smile still on her lips. \"Isn't that what you wanted, Lord Nicolas? For me to behave? To finally be 'taught a lesson'? Well, I've learned it. I'm quiet now. Isn't that what makes you happy?\"\n\nNicolas stared at her in silence.\n\nShe was smiling, yes—but it never reached her eyes. She hadn't said a single word of accusation, yet the guilt hit him like a knife to the chest.\n\nHis expression began to soften, just as he opened his mouth to speak—when Willow's voice suddenly broke in.\n\n\"This is all my fault. I'm the one who should be blamed. If my body weren't so weak—if I hadn't reacted badly to the medicine—Athena never would've been punished.\n\n\"I was never meant to belong to this family anyway. Maybe… maybe I should go live in the countryside with my birth parents…\"\n\nShe dissolved into sobs, her voice quivering with each breath. Tears streamed freely down her face, as if she were the one who had suffered.\n\nImmediately, Eloise rushed to her side, flustered, gently stroking her back. \"There, don't cry, darling. You'll make yourself sick.\"\n\nNicolas jumped in too, alarmed. \"You know how fragile your health is—what are you doing, crying like this? If I'd known, I never would've let you come. Now look what's happened.\"\n\nThen he turned, casting a sharp look at Athena. As if to say, \"Why do you have to show those wounds? Now Grandmother is heartbroken, Willow is in tears, and Mother is riddled with guilt.\"",

Don't think being the daughter of duke's estate means someone's going to back you up!\"\n\n\"There never was anyone before, and there sure won't be in the future.\" Athena Monson's face was expressionless, her voice hollow. She nodded meekly, not daring to defy the steward.\n\nLeaning against the wall for support, she slowly made her way out of the camp.\n\nShe had once lit up Pidence City with her dazzling dance. Now her knees, ruined from years of injury, could barely hold her weight. Without medicine, even her skill in healing was useless.\n\nJust outside the camp, she heard someone call her name. Flinching, she lifted her head hesitantly.\n\nWhat met her eyes was a majestic steed, a royal gift, and astride it sat the Marquis of Somers—Michael Osborne. The famed war god himself.\n\nHe sat tall and poised, broad shoulders tapering to a lean waist, his face strikingly handsome. He still carried that same air of noble elegance.\n\nThis was the man she had loved for three long years. She had seen this scene in her dreams countless times—him finally coming to take her home.\n\nHer eyes filled with tears, and she opened her mouth to speak, but no words came.\n\nBecause it was him—he was the one who had thrown her into this hellish camp, ordering others to \"teach her a lesson.\"\n\nThe cold indifference in his eyes made her already shattered heart tremble again.\n\n\"I can take you home,\" Michael said, looking down at her from his horse, eyes like ice, his tone as sharp as a blade. \"But tell me—do you finally admit you were wrong?\n\n\"If you hadn't poisoned the pastries back then, Willow wouldn't be living with a chronic illness. She still needs daily medicine. You only suffered three years of punishment—she'll suffer for the rest of her life. You owe her forever!\"\n\nWhen Athena remained silent, Michael snapped, \"Answer me! Do you admit your guilt?\"\n\nThe sudden sharpness in his voice made her jump. Reflexively, she shut her eyes, wrapped her arms around her head, and crouched down, crying out, \"I admit it! I was wrong! I'll never do it again!\"\n\nBut the lash she expected never came. Only then did she remember—he was the Marquis of Somers. A man like him would never lower himself to beat someone like her.\n\nStill, she truly had been wrong. She was wrong to care. Wrong to love. Wrong to give her heart to people who treated it like nothing.\n\nWhen she'd first been thrown into the camp, she still clung to a shred of hope.\n\nShe had thought, 'My fiancé can't really be that heartless. He has protected me since our engagement—risking his life, even, to spare me from harm.\n\n'And my parents in the duke's estate—surely, they would come for me. I have been framed.'\n\nBut she waited. And waited. And what came instead was nothing but torment—merciless, day after day, at the hands of the soldiers.\n\nShe was a noblewoman, not a camp whore. They didn't dare touch her, which only made them more creative in how they broke her.\n\nSometimes, they beat her with slender whips made specifically for disciplining women—tools that cut deep and left her flesh in tatters. Other times, they stripped her naked and tossed her into the snow.\n\nThey were waiting for her to beg. To give in. To offer her body in exchange for a bite of food or a few days of peace.\n\nBut she never did. So their torment grew nastier, more degrading, every time.\n\nEventually, she stopped fighting back—not out of obedience, but because she no longer had the strength to resist.\n\n\"Athena, what game are you playing now?\" Michael frowned, his tone sharp with disdain.\n\nHe wondered, 'Three years of discipline, and she's ended up this pathetic?'\n\nThe once-glowing beauty of her face was gone—now it was sickly pale and hollow. Her waist, once soft and full, had thinned so much it looked like it might snap under a strong breeze.\n\nHe thought, 'Trying to act pitiful? I am not falling for it. I personally ordered my men to take good care of her. There is no way she's truly been mistreated.'\n\nTurning away, Michael dismounted. He reached out a hand toward her. \"Get in the carriage.\"\n\nBut she recoiled like a wounded animal, clutching her head, eyes blank, voice trembling as she pleaded, \"No… please don't… don't touch me…\"\n\n\"That's enough,\" he snapped. \"Still pretending to be pitiful?\"\n\nHis voice turned colder. \"What, is this your way of making me feel guilty?\"\n\nAthena slowly came back to herself. Her voice was dry, hoarse. She gave a hollow laugh, laced with self-mockery.\n\nIn front of Michael—or her parents—she had never once had the right to feel wronged.\n\nIf they'd ever truly felt guilty, they wouldn't have waited until now.\n\nThirteen years ago, her birth parents finally brought her home to the duke's estate. That was when she found out the truth—she'd been swapped at birth.\n\nThe greedy couple who raised her had traded her away and left her to suffer five bitter years.\n\nShe'd thought that returning to her real family meant love and acceptance. But what she got instead was coldness.\n\nHer parents and brothers barely looked at her.\n\nWhenever Willow Monson—the girl who'd lived her life—felt sad or neglected, they rushed to comfort her, as if she were the real daughter.\n\nLittle by little, Athena was pushed aside.\n\nThey constantly reminded her, \"You're the older sister. You should be the mature one. Be patient with Willow. Don't fight. Don't compete.\"\n\nWanting so desperately to belong, Athena did as she was told. She gave way in everything, always stepping aside for Willow.\n\nThree years ago, she even made pastries by hand to try to please her.\n\nBut Willow ended up poisoned—vomiting blood.\n\nTheir parents were furious. They said Athena's years away had corrupted her to the bone. Said she wasn't worthy of being their daughter.\n\nEgged on by Willow's whispers, they decided to send her away—banished from Pidence City forever.\n\nEven the brothers who once adored her said, \"Willow might've enjoyed your life for over a decade, but she's innocent. How could you use such cruel tactics just to win attention? We don't have a sister as heartless as you!\"\n\nNo matter how Athena tried to explain, no one believed her. Not once.\n\nThe moment Willow shed a tear, the blame fell on Athena.\n\nIn the end, it was Michael who stepped in to stop them from sending her away.\n\nBut he didn't save her. He simply had her quietly dumped in the military camp—believing that after enough suffering, she'd finally learn her place.\n\nA gust of wind lifted the tangled strands of Athena's hair, revealing her emaciated, unrecognizable face.\n\nMichael scowled. \"Get up. We're going back to the estate.\"\n\nAthena tried, but her legs gave out beneath her, and she crumpled to the ground again.\n\nMichael turned back, his eyes flashing cold steel. \"If you'd rather not go back… then drag yourself back into that camp.\"\n\n# Chapter 2 Realize Your Mistake?\n\nAthena lowered her gaze, gritted her teeth, and forced herself to stand. She didn't say a word as she clumsily climbed into the carriage, using both hands and knees.\n\nHer legs throbbed with pain, barely able to hold her, and she looked completely wretched.\n\nMichael turned away, refusing to watch. He had assumed three years of punishment would be enough to wear down her spirit, but the moment they met again, she was already trying to play the victim—putting on a show to win his sympathy.\n\nIf it hadn't been for that person's orders, he wouldn't have come for her at all.\n\nWhat baffled him was why someone of such high rank would even notice Athena—let alone give an order about her the moment he returned to Pidence City.\n\nMichael was the first to get out of the carriage. Without a glance back, he instructed his men, \"I have business back at camp. After you drop her off, get rid of the carriage—I don't want to see it again. It's filthy.\"\n\nFilthy. The word hit her like a slap. Athena's chest ached with a dull, sinking pain. She sniffed quietly, face devoid of emotion, and stepped down from the carriage.\n\nOutside the towering red gates of the duke's estate, a woman was already waiting. The moment she saw Athena, she rushed over, eyes full of urgency.\n\nBut the first thing she said was, \"My sweet daughter, it's been three years. Have you finally realized your mistake?\"\n\n\"I have,\" Athena replied flatly.\n\nHer mistake had been wanting love too much. This time, she would sever those ties—for good. Just… not yet. Not while Margaret Monson, her grandmother, still needed her care.\n\nEloise Monson looked at Athena, her daughter—so thin and pale, her eyes distant—and her expression faltered.\n\nThree years of hardship had changed Athena completely. Just one look was enough to make her heart ache.\n\nNo matter how deeply Athena had erred, she was still her daughter—still her flesh and blood. And she had clearly paid the price.\n\n\"It's good you understand now,\" Eloise said softly. \"You mustn't be so willful again. Come on, get up.\" She reached out to help.\n\nBut Athena immediately stood up on her own and took a step back, putting distance between them. Her eyes were guarded, cautious.\n\nEloise's heart twisted. \"You blame me for being too harsh? But I did it for your own good—for your future! What mother doesn't want the best for her child?\"\n\nHer eyes turned red, her voice trembling with a hint of tears. \"Don't hold it against me…\"\n\nHer face was full of sorrow, as though she were the one who'd suffered for three years.\n\nAthena stood there, unmoved, making no effort to bridge the gap between them.\n\nJust then, a slender figure stepped gracefully out of the manor and gently supported Eloise's arm.\n\n\"Mother, Athena's just come home. She's probably overwhelmed. Don't be upset if she seems distant—give her a little time, all right?\"\n\nThe girl was delicate and fair, with porcelain skin and a sweet, innocent smile.\n\nShe turned to Athena and extended her hand, her eyes wide with sincerity. \"Athena, I don't hold anything against you. Let's forget the past, okay? We're still family—we should love each other, just like before.\"\n\nHer smile was as gentle and harmless as ever.\n\nAthena almost laughed out loud. After everything she'd endured, she wondered, 'Do they really think a few nice words can just wipe it all away?'\n\n\"Love? Between you and me?\" Disgust flickered in her eyes.\n\nThat was when someone finally lost patience.\n\n\"Willow's already gone out of her way to be kind to you, and you're still acting like this? What's wrong with your attitude?\"\n\nNicolas Monson had just come from court, still in his crimson official robes. He swung off his horse and walked over, clearly irritated.\n\n\"You think you're the only one who's suffered these past three years? Do you have any idea what Mother's been through? She's lost sleep night after night, her hair's turning white!\n\n\"If it weren't for Willow taking care of her and fulfilling your duties, who knows what would've happened?\"\n\nNicolas had seen the whole scene earlier—Eloise's joy quickly deflated, Willow's soft voice met with Athena's cold rejection.\n\nNicolas thought, 'And all because of three years of punishment? What right does she have to act wronged? Willow almost died.'\n\nEloise frowned at Nicolas, her son, clearly disapproving. \"Don't exaggerate. She just got back. As her big brother, you should be gentler with her. Don't scare her.\"\n\n\"Mother, you don't need to defend her. The Monson family owes her nothing. She's the one who made the mistake. And because of her, our entire household's reputation suffered.\n\n\"Everyone in Pidence City knows the Duke's family raised a vicious, manipulative girl. And Willow? She never complained—she's done everything she could to protect this family.\"\n\nNicolas still hadn't calmed down.\n\n\"Athena! Willow even covered for you—she told everyone you never poisoned her, just to protect your name. Shouldn't you be grateful?\" he continued.\n\nWhen Athena said nothing, his voice rose sharply. \"Say something! Are you mute now?\"\n\nAthena blinked, struggling to hold back the sting in her eyes.\n\nOnce upon a time, Nicolas had been different. Unlike her second and third brothers, he had been the one who truly cared for her.\n\nHe once told her he'd split the love he gave Willow and give half to her—and for a while, he meant it.\n\nWhen the servants looked down on her, he gave out thirty lashes on her behalf. On her birthday, he carved a jewel pendant for her by hand. When she was sick, he stayed by her side through the night.\n\nBut all that kindness vanished the moment Willow acted hurt.\n\nLove that could be so easily withdrawn—that kind of love, she no longer wanted.\n\nThe air between them turned stiff with silence.\n\nEloise quickly stepped in to smooth things over. \"What's done is done. Let's go inside—your father and grandmother are still waiting.\"\n\nNicolas scoffed and gave a dismissive wave of his sleeve as he turned toward the estate.\n\nAfter a few steps, he looked back, his voice suddenly soft. \"Willow, come here.\"\n\n\"Yes, Nicolas.\" She smiled sweetly, casting a glance at Athena. She said nothing—but somehow, it said everything.\n\nAthena was used to it by now. She had always been the outsider in this family.\n\nShe had already made up her mind: she would let go. Let Willow have all of it—Michael, her parents, her brothers.\n\nBut even with that resolve, watching this unfold still made her throat tighten and her eyes sting.\n\n# Chapter 3 Oversized Clothes\n\nEloise led Athena through the gates of the estate, turning to the servants as they entered. \"Take Lady Athena to wash up first. After that, she'll go pay her respects to Lady Margaret.\"\n\nThen she looked at Athena with a gentle smile. \"Your grandmother's getting on in years. Her health hasn't been great—she's been relying on herbal tonics these past few years. When you see her, be sweet and respectful, and don't bring up anything about the last three years. It'll only upset her.\"\n\nAthena nodded quietly.\n\nMargaret had always been the most fair-minded person in the family—but she was too old now to involve herself in household affairs.\n\nSeeing Athena accept her words without protest, Eloise finally relaxed a little.\n\nShe continued, testing the waters, \"You're eighteen now—of marriageable age. What happened in the camp... let's not mention it again. If word gets out that you spent the last three years living among soldiers, day and night, people will start talking.\n\n\"That kind of gossip could ruin your chances of a good match. I've already come up with an explanation. We'll say you were away recuperating, and now you've just returned.\"\n\nAthena's face remained calm. She gave a soft \"Yes,\" then followed the maid assigned to her.\n\nBut after a few turns, she realized something was wrong. This wasn't the way to her old courtyard.\n\nShe asked, and the maid smiled brightly as she explained, \"Lady Willow has been in poor health for years. The doctor said the trees in your courtyard were too damp and affected her health. So they were all cut down.\n\n\"To help her recover, they leveled your courtyard and merged it with hers. They even diverted hot spring water to the new space for her treatment. But don't worry, Lady Eloise had this new courtyard cleaned and prepared for you before your return.\"\n\nThe maid said it as if it were completely normal, perfectly reasonable.\n\nAs if everyone had conveniently forgotten that Athena was the true daughter of the house—while Willow was merely adopted.\n\nThe maid led Athena to a small, modest courtyard and pushed the door open. \"You'll be staying here from now on, Lady Athena.\"\n\nThe space was much smaller than her original quarters, and with no greenery in sight, it looked bare and lifeless.\n\nTwo unfamiliar maids stepped forward and bowed. \"Lady Athena.\"\n\nAthena didn't recognize either of them. After three years away, most of the household staff had changed.\n\nOne had a round face, the other an oval one. Both were attractive and sharp-eyed—clearly selected for looks and cleverness.\n\n\"I'm Siena Hotham.\"\n\n\"I'm Aliza Crofton.\"\n\nTogether, they echoed, \"Hi, Lady Athena.\"\n\nAthena gave a small nod and motioned for them to rise.\n\nThen she asked, \"Where are Thalia and Macy?\"\n\nThose had been her personal maids before she was sent away. But once she entered the military camp, all news of them vanished.\n\nThe maid smiled and replied, \"Not long after you left, they both got married. I imagine they're living quiet, peaceful lives now—looking after their husbands and raising children.\"\n\nAthena nodded. A peaceful life sounded good. Far better than serving others for the rest of your days.\n\nThe thought brought a faint sense of ease. She stepped inside.\n\nThe table was already set. The meal was generous—four dishes and a soup—but the plates were no bigger than a clenched fist.\n\nShe began to eat. One plate of pasta disappeared in just a few bites.\n\nHer brows knit slightly. \"Is there more?\"\n\nSiena looked momentarily stunned, then quickly nodded. \"Yes, of course, I'll get it right away.\"\n\nWatching her eat so fast, Aliza spoke up gently, \"Lady Athena, please slow down. You'll upset your stomach if you rush like that.\"\n\nAthena's fork paused in mid-air. She had nearly forgotten—this wasn't the military camp anymore.\n\nThis was the duke's estate. No one here was going to snatch her food. No one would dump kitchen slop onto her plate.\n\nThe pasta was fragrant. The dishes were fresh. And the meat—it was real bacon. Not rat. Not snake.\n\nSiena returned with two more plates of pasta.\n\nAthena ate quickly and without grace. There was nothing delicate or refined in her manners—she looked more like a starving beggar than a noble daughter.\n\nSiena opened her mouth several times to speak but held her tongue each time.\n\nAfter the meal, the servants had already prepared hot water for her bath. Siena and Aliza followed her in. \"Lady Athena, allow us to help you bathe,\" Siena offered politely.\n\n\"That won't be necessary. You can leave.\" Athena said.\n\nSiena hesitated, clearly unsure.\n\nAliza added with concern, \"If Lady Eloise finds out, she'll punish us for not serving you properly…\"\n\nAthena didn't speak. She simply looked at them—calm, expressionless.\n\nThere was no anger in her eyes, no emotion at all. But the chill behind that blank gaze made both girls shiver.\n\nWithout another word, they backed out of the room and quietly closed the door behind them.\n\nOnly then did Athena step behind the screen and begin undressing.\n\nHer body was gaunt, skin stretched tightly over bone. Her once-fair skin was now covered in bruises—some new, others long faded.\n\nIf she hadn't known medicine, she would have died in that place.\n\nAfter washing, she reached for the fresh clothes laid out on the rack. The fabric was fine—soft, warm, and tailored to fit.\n\nBut on her starved frame, the robe hung loose and shapeless, making her look more like a walking skeleton than a noble daughter.\n\n\"Lady Athena, Lady Eloise and the Lady Margaret are waiting,\" Aliza reminded her from outside.\n\nAthena nodded and made her way toward Starling House.\n\nIn just three years, the duke's estate had changed so much.\n\nShe paused at the edge of the pond, lost in thought. \"What happened to the lotuses?\" she asked.\n\n\"Lady Willow said there were too many mosquitoes in summer,\" Aliza replied. \"So Lord Nicolas had them all removed.\"\n\nAthena thought, 'Of course. Willow—again.' Athena felt a familiar ache in her chest.\n\nWhen she had first arrived at the estate, she tried so hard to win everyone over.\n\nShe had planted those lotuses herself, hoping to make wine from the blossoms and gift it to Nicolas.\n\nHe had laughed at her back then. \"You're my sister. There's no need for all that. But if it makes you happy, I'll help you plant them.\"\n\nThe proud, aloof heir of the house had actually gotten his hands dirty—for her.\n\nAt the time, Athena had thought, 'So this is what it feels like to be cherished.'\n\nBut now… it was clear. Whatever kindness they'd shown her didn't come close to how they treated Willow. Not even a tenth of it.\n\nShe arrived at Margaret's quarters. The room was already full.\n\nEloise looked toward the door—and frowned. She wondered, 'Why does the robe look so oversized on Athena?'\n\n# Chapter 4 The One To Blame\n\nBefore Athena could say a word, Nicolas stepped forward, blocking Margaret's view.\n\n\"Athena! Are you doing this on purpose?\" he snapped. \"Three years weren't enough to teach you some manners? Still playing your little games? You've really let me down!\"\n\n\"I told you to present yourself properly. What are you wearing?\" His expression was full of disapproval, his tone unconsciously laced with the stern authority of a Justice Ministry official.\n\nHe looked at her like she was standing trial. \"If you've got complaints, direct them at me. Why come here and put on a show in front of Grandmother? Are you trying to make her feel sorry for you? Do you want to upset her so badly she falls ill?\"\n\nAthena almost laughed out loud.\n\nShe raised an eyebrow, her smile cool and detached. \"The clothes? Lady Eloise picked them out. What did you expect me to wear—what I came back in from the military camp?\"\n\nThat shut him up. For a moment, Nicolas was at a loss. She had called Eloise \"Lady Eloise\"—not \"Mother.\"\n\nOnly then did it hit him: ever since Athena returned, she hadn't regarded him as brother once either.\n\nA flicker of unease crept into his chest. The harsh words caught in his throat and never made it out.\n\nHis gaze narrowed, a thought nagging at the back of his mind. 'It's only been three years… how did she waste away like this?'\n\nEloise quickly stepped in to smooth things over. \"That was my oversight. Don't be too hard on Athena.\"\n\nNicolas stepped aside, allowing Athena to enter.\n\nMargaret's eyes lit up the moment she saw her.\n\n\"Come here, come,\" she called, voice trembling slightly. \"Let me take a good look at you.\"\n\nThat warmth, that longing in her eyes—Athena felt her nose sting. She stepped forward and let Margaret take her hands and look her over from head to toe.\n\n\"How did you get so thin?\" Margaret pulled her into a hug, holding her tightly, voice choked with emotion. \"My sweet girl… you've suffered. It's all my fault. I'm too old, too useless… I couldn't protect you…\"\n\nAthena knew how things had gone. Back then, Margaret had stood by her, even if it meant alienating the rest of the family. Her health had already been fragile.",

Don't think being the daughter of duke's estate means someone's going to back you up!\"\n\n\"There never was anyone before, and there sure won't be in the future.\" Athena Monson's face was expressionless, her voice hollow. She nodded meekly, not daring to defy the steward.\n\nLeaning against the wall for support, she slowly made her way out of the camp.\n\nShe had once lit up Pidence City with her dazzling dance. Now her knees, ruined from years of injury, could barely hold her weight. Without medicine, even her skill in healing was useless.\n\nJust outside the camp, she heard someone call her name. Flinching, she lifted her head hesitantly.\n\nWhat met her eyes was a majestic steed, a royal gift, and astride it sat the Marquis of Somers—Michael Osborne. The famed war god himself.\n\nHe sat tall and poised, broad shoulders tapering to a lean waist, his face strikingly handsome. He still carried that same air of noble elegance.\n\nThis was the man she had loved for three long years. She had seen this scene in her dreams countless times—him finally coming to take her home.\n\nHer eyes filled with tears, and she opened her mouth to speak, but no words came.\n\nBecause it was him—he was the one who had thrown her into this hellish camp, ordering others to \"teach her a lesson.\"\n\nThe cold indifference in his eyes made her already shattered heart tremble again.\n\n\"I can take you home,\" Michael said, looking down at her from his horse, eyes like ice, his tone as sharp as a blade. \"But tell me—do you finally admit you were wrong?\n\n\"If you hadn't poisoned the pastries back then, Willow wouldn't be living with a chronic illness. She still needs daily medicine. You only suffered three years of punishment—she'll suffer for the rest of her life. You owe her forever!\"\n\nWhen Athena remained silent, Michael snapped, \"Answer me! Do you admit your guilt?\"\n\nThe sudden sharpness in his voice made her jump. Reflexively, she shut her eyes, wrapped her arms around her head, and crouched down, crying out, \"I admit it! I was wrong! I'll never do it again!\"\n\nBut the lash she expected never came. Only then did she remember—he was the Marquis of Somers. A man like him would never lower himself to beat someone like her.\n\nStill, she truly had been wrong. She was wrong to care. Wrong to love. Wrong to give her heart to people who treated it like nothing.\n\nWhen she'd first been thrown into the camp, she still clung to a shred of hope.\n\nShe had thought, 'My fiancé can't really be that heartless. He has protected me since our engagement—risking his life, even, to spare me from harm.\n\n'And my parents in the duke's estate—surely, they would come for me. I have been framed.'\n\nBut she waited. And waited. And what came instead was nothing but torment—merciless, day after day, at the hands of the soldiers.\n\nShe was a noblewoman, not a camp whore. They didn't dare touch her, which only made them more creative in how they broke her.\n\nSometimes, they beat her with slender whips made specifically for disciplining women—tools that cut deep and left her flesh in tatters. Other times, they stripped her naked and tossed her into the snow.\n\nThey were waiting for her to beg. To give in. To offer her body in exchange for a bite of food or a few days of peace.\n\nBut she never did. So their torment grew nastier, more degrading, every time.\n\nEventually, she stopped fighting back—not out of obedience, but because she no longer had the strength to resist.\n\n\"Athena, what game are you playing now?\" Michael frowned, his tone sharp with disdain.\n\nHe wondered, 'Three years of discipline, and she's ended up this pathetic?'\n\nThe once-glowing beauty of her face was gone—now it was sickly pale and hollow. Her waist, once soft and full, had thinned so much it looked like it might snap under a strong breeze.\n\nHe thought, 'Trying to act pitiful? I am not falling for it. I personally ordered my men to take good care of her. There is no way she's truly been mistreated.'\n\nTurning away, Michael dismounted. He reached out a hand toward her. \"Get in the carriage.\"\n\nBut she recoiled like a wounded animal, clutching her head, eyes blank, voice trembling as she pleaded, \"No… please don't… don't touch me…\"\n\n\"That's enough,\" he snapped. \"Still pretending to be pitiful?\"\n\nHis voice turned colder. \"What, is this your way of making me feel guilty?\"\n\nAthena slowly came back to herself. Her voice was dry, hoarse. She gave a hollow laugh, laced with self-mockery.\n\nIn front of Michael—or her parents—she had never once had the right to feel wronged.\n\nIf they'd ever truly felt guilty, they wouldn't have waited until now.\n\nThirteen years ago, her birth parents finally brought her home to the duke's estate. That was when she found out the truth—she'd been swapped at birth.\n\nThe greedy couple who raised her had traded her away and left her to suffer five bitter years.\n\nShe'd thought that returning to her real family meant love and acceptance. But what she got instead was coldness.\n\nHer parents and brothers barely looked at her.\n\nWhenever Willow Monson—the girl who'd lived her life—felt sad or neglected, they rushed to comfort her, as if she were the real daughter.\n\nLittle by little, Athena was pushed aside.\n\nThey constantly reminded her, \"You're the older sister. You should be the mature one. Be patient with Willow. Don't fight. Don't compete.\"\n\nWanting so desperately to belong, Athena did as she was told. She gave way in everything, always stepping aside for Willow.\n\nThree years ago, she even made pastries by hand to try to please her.\n\nBut Willow ended up poisoned—vomiting blood.\n\nTheir parents were furious. They said Athena's years away had corrupted her to the bone. Said she wasn't worthy of being their daughter.\n\nEgged on by Willow's whispers, they decided to send her away—banished from Pidence City forever.\n\nEven the brothers who once adored her said, \"Willow might've enjoyed your life for over a decade, but she's innocent. How could you use such cruel tactics just to win attention? We don't have a sister as heartless as you!\"\n\nNo matter how Athena tried to explain, no one believed her. Not once.\n\nThe moment Willow shed a tear, the blame fell on Athena.\n\nIn the end, it was Michael who stepped in to stop them from sending her away.\n\nBut he didn't save her. He simply had her quietly dumped in the military camp—believing that after enough suffering, she'd finally learn her place.\n\nA gust of wind lifted the tangled strands of Athena's hair, revealing her emaciated, unrecognizable face.\n\nMichael scowled. \"Get up. We're going back to the estate.\"\n\nAthena tried, but her legs gave out beneath her, and she crumpled to the ground again.\n\nMichael turned back, his eyes flashing cold steel. \"If you'd rather not go back… then drag yourself back into that camp.\"\n\nChapter 2 Realize Your Mistake?\n\nAthena lowered her gaze, gritted her teeth, and forced herself to stand. She didn't say a word as she clumsily climbed into the carriage, using both hands and knees.\n\nHer legs throbbed with pain, barely able to hold her, and she looked completely wretched.\n\nMichael turned away, refusing to watch. He had assumed three years of punishment would be enough to wear down her spirit, but the moment they met again, she was already trying to play the victim—putting on a show to win his sympathy.\n\nIf it hadn't been for that person's orders, he wouldn't have come for her at all.\n\nWhat baffled him was why someone of such high rank would even notice Athena—let alone give an order about her the moment he returned to Pidence City.\n\nMichael was the first to get out of the carriage. Without a glance back, he instructed his men, \"I have business back at camp. After you drop her off, get rid of the carriage—I don't want to see it again. It's filthy.\"\n\nFilthy. The word hit her like a slap. Athena's chest ached with a dull, sinking pain. She sniffed quietly, face devoid of emotion, and stepped down from the carriage.\n\nOutside the towering red gates of the duke's estate, a woman was already waiting. The moment she saw Athena, she rushed over, eyes full of urgency.\n\nBut the first thing she said was, \"My sweet daughter, it's been three years. Have you finally realized your mistake?\"\n\n\"I have,\" Athena replied flatly.\n\nHer mistake had been wanting love too much. This time, she would sever those ties—for good. Just… not yet. Not while Margaret Monson, her grandmother, still needed her care.\n\nEloise Monson looked at Athena, her daughter—so thin and pale, her eyes distant—and her expression faltered.\n\nThree years of hardship had changed Athena completely. Just one look was enough to make her heart ache.\n\nNo matter how deeply Athena had erred, she was still her daughter—still her flesh and blood. And she had clearly paid the price.\n\n\"It's good you understand now,\" Eloise said softly. \"You mustn't be so willful again. Come on, get up.\" She reached out to help.\n\nBut Athena immediately stood up on her own and took a step back, putting distance between them. Her eyes were guarded, cautious.\n\nEloise's heart twisted. \"You blame me for being too harsh? But I did it for your own good—for your future! What mother doesn't want the best for her child?\"\n\nHer eyes turned red, her voice trembling with a hint of tears. \"Don't hold it against me…\"\n\nHer face was full of sorrow, as though she were the one who'd suffered for three years.\n\nAthena stood there, unmoved, making no effort to bridge the gap between them.\n\nJust then, a slender figure stepped gracefully out of the manor and gently supported Eloise's arm.\n\n\"Mother, Athena's just come home. She's probably overwhelmed. Don't be upset if she seems distant—give her a little time, all right?\"\n\nThe girl was delicate and fair, with porcelain skin and a sweet, innocent smile.\n\nShe turned to Athena and extended her hand, her eyes wide with sincerity. \"Athena, I don't hold anything against you. Let's forget the past, okay? We're still family—we should love each other, just like before.\"\n\nHer smile was as gentle and harmless as ever.\n\nAthena almost laughed out loud. After everything she'd endured, she wondered, 'Do they really think a few nice words can just wipe it all away?'\n\n\"Love? Between you and me?\" Disgust flickered in her eyes.\n\nThat was when someone finally lost patience.\n\n\"Willow's already gone out of her way to be kind to you, and you're still acting like this? What's wrong with your attitude?\"\n\nNicolas Monson had just come from court, still in his crimson official robes. He swung off his horse and walked over, clearly irritated.\n\n\"You think you're the only one who's suffered these past three years? Do you have any idea what Mother's been through? She's lost sleep night after night, her hair's turning white!\n\n\"If it weren't for Willow taking care of her and fulfilling your duties, who knows what would've happened?\"\n\nNicolas had seen the whole scene earlier—Eloise's joy quickly deflated, Willow's soft voice met with Athena's cold rejection.\n\nNicolas thought, 'And all because of three years of punishment?

I imagine they're living quiet, peaceful lives now—looking after their husbands and raising children.\"\n\nAthena nodded. A peaceful life sounded good. Far better than serving others for the rest of your days.\n\nThe thought brought a faint sense of ease. She stepped inside.\n\nThe table was already set. The meal was generous—four dishes and a soup—but the plates were no bigger than a clenched fist.\n\nShe began to eat. One plate of pasta disappeared in just a few bites.\n\nHer brows knit slightly. \"Is there more?\"\n\nSiena looked momentarily stunned, then quickly nodded. \"Yes, of course, I'll get it right away.\"\n\nWatching her eat so fast, Aliza spoke up gently, \"Lady Athena, please slow down. You'll upset your stomach if you rush like that.\"\n\nAthena's fork paused in mid-air. She had nearly forgotten—this wasn't the military camp anymore.\n\nThis was the duke's estate. No one here was going to snatch her food. No one would dump kitchen slop onto her plate.\n\nThe pasta was fragrant. The dishes were fresh. And the meat—it was real bacon. Not rat. Not snake.\n\nSiena returned with two more plates of pasta.\n\nAthena ate quickly and without grace. There was nothing delicate or refined in her manners—she looked more like a starving beggar than a noble daughter.\n\nSiena opened her mouth several times to speak but held her tongue each time.\n\nAfter the meal, the servants had already prepared hot water for her bath. Siena and Aliza followed her in. \"Lady Athena, allow us to help you bathe,\" Siena offered politely.\n\n\"That won't be necessary. You can leave.\" Athena said.\n\nSiena hesitated, clearly unsure.\n\nAliza added with concern, \"If Lady Eloise finds out, she'll punish us for not serving you properly…\"\n\nAthena didn't speak. She simply looked at them—calm, expressionless.\n\nThere was no anger in her eyes, no emotion at all. But the chill behind that blank gaze made both girls shiver.\n\nWithout another word, they backed out of the room and quietly closed the door behind them.\n\nOnly then did Athena step behind the screen and begin undressing.\n\nHer body was gaunt, skin stretched tightly over bone. Her once-fair skin was now covered in bruises—some new, others long faded.\n\nIf she hadn't known medicine, she would have died in that place.\n\nAfter washing, she reached for the fresh clothes laid out on the rack. The fabric was fine—soft, warm, and tailored to fit.\n\nBut on her starved frame, the robe hung loose and shapeless, making her look more like a walking skeleton than a noble daughter.\n\n\"Lady Athena, Lady Eloise and the Lady Margaret are waiting,\" Aliza reminded her from outside.\n\nAthena nodded and made her way toward Starling House.\n\nIn just three years, the duke's estate had changed so much.\n\nShe paused at the edge of the pond, lost in thought. \"What happened to the lotuses?\" she asked.\n\n\"Lady Willow said there were too many mosquitoes in summer,\" Aliza replied. \"So Lord Nicolas had them all removed.\"\n\nAthena thought, 'Of course. Willow—again.' Athena felt a familiar ache in her chest.\n\nWhen she had first arrived at the estate, she tried so hard to win everyone over.\n\nShe had planted those lotuses herself, hoping to make wine from the blossoms and gift it to Nicolas.",

    "query": "Why Crypto IRA Is the Next Big Thing in the Crypto Space",
    "source": "reddit",
    "upvotes": 1,
    "body": "The cryptocurrency industry has evolved from a fringe movement into a trillion-dollar asset class in just over a decade. Bitcoin and Ethereum are now household names. Institutions are involved. ETFs are gaining approval. But as crypto matures, the conversation is shifting from speculation to strategy. And that’s where Crypto IRAs come in.\n\nA **Crypto IRA** (Individual Retirement Account) is exactly what it sounds like: a retirement account that lets you invest in cryptocurrencies, tax-advantaged. For crypto believers and forward-looking investors, it’s becoming one of the smartest ways to hold digital assets long-term. Here’s why Crypto IRAs are poised to be the next big thing in the crypto space.\n\n# 1. Tax Advantages + Long-Term Gains = Perfect Match\n\nCryptocurrency is volatile. But it’s also, historically, one of the best-performing assets. Bitcoin has delivered annualized returns that make the S&amp;P 500 look sluggish. Ethereum isn’t far behind. Still, every crypto trader knows the sting of capital gains taxes, especially short-term ones.\n\nA Crypto IRA changes the game. Depending on the type (Traditional or Roth), you can either:\n\n* **Defer taxes** until retirement (Traditional), or  \n* **Pay taxes upfront** and then withdraw everything **tax-free** later (Roth).  \n\nImagine buying Bitcoin at $30,000 in a Roth IRA and it grows to $300,000 by retirement. You sell, and owe **zero** capital gains tax. That’s not a loophole. That’s the power of tax-advantaged accounts. For crypto HODLers with a long time horizon, there’s no better setup.\n\n[Learn More About Crypto IRA Here](https://www.goldira.directory/recommends/itrustc-reddit/)\n\n# 2. Retirement Accounts Are Massive, And Under-Innovated\n\nThe U.S. retirement market is huge, over **$35 trillion** in assets. Most of it is tied up in traditional investments: stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. But the next generation of investors is different. They’re digital-native, skeptical of legacy finance, and bullish on crypto.\n\nAs Gen Z and Millennials start thinking seriously about retirement, they’re not satisfied with stale 60/40 portfolios. They want exposure to Bitcoin, Ethereum, and altcoins. They want self-custody, decentralization, and asset sovereignty. Crypto IRAs meet them where they are.\n\nFinancial institutions are slowly waking up to this shift. Fidelity now offers Bitcoin in 401(k)s. Coinbase and other platforms offer IRA options. This isn’t a fad. It’s a generational pivot in wealth planning.\n\n# 3. Diversification Beyond Traditional Assets\n\nCrypto isn’t just about Bitcoin anymore. DeFi, NFTs, Web3 tokens, and staking-based assets offer diverse exposure within the ecosystem. Crypto IRAs enable diversification not just across coins, but across **crypto sectors**, something a traditional IRA simply can’t do.\n\nMore importantly, crypto offers **non-correlated returns**. When traditional markets tank, crypto sometimes follows, but sometimes it doesn’t. For investors seeking true diversification, a slice of crypto can balance risk, especially when combined with the tax efficiency of an IRA.\n\n# 4. Crypto IRAs Aren’t Just Passive Accounts Anymore\n\nThe earliest Crypto IRA products were clunky. Few options, high fees, no flexibility. That’s changing fast.\n\nNow, leading platforms let you:\n\n* **Trade actively** within your IRA  \n* **Stake tokens** to earn rewards  \n* **Hold multiple coins**, not just Bitcoin  \n* **Use cold storage** or self-directed wallets  \n* **Access DeFi protocols** (in some cases)  \n\nIn other words, your IRA can now look and act like a modern crypto wallet, but with tax perks. This evolution is unlocking a new type of crypto investor: strategic, patient, and focused on long-term wealth.\n\n# 5. Self-Directed IRAs Are Going Mainstream\n\nA Crypto IRA is a type of **Self-Directed IRA (SDIRA)**, a lesser-known cousin of the regular IRA. Self-directed means you can invest in alternative assets: real estate, gold, private equity, and yes, cryptocurrency.\n\nUntil recently, SDIRAs were niche products, mostly used by savvy investors. But crypto is dragging them into the spotlight. Platforms like iTrustCapital, AltoIRA, and BitIRA are making it simple to open a Crypto IRA in minutes, not months.\n\nThe barriers are falling. Account minimums are lower. Interfaces are user-friendly. Compliance is handled. You don’t need to be a financial advisor to get started. And that democratization is fueling adoption.\n\n\n\n\n\n# 6. Regulatory Clarity Is Finally Emerging\n\nRegulatory uncertainty has long been crypto’s Achilles’ heel. But the landscape is stabilizing. Major rulings are beginning to define what’s allowed, what’s not, and what falls into gray zones. While there’s still debate over classification (securities vs. commodities), Crypto IRAs operate under **clear legal structures** thanks to existing SDIRA laws.\n\nThat gives investors confidence. They’re not gambling on legal loopholes, they’re using a compliant, IRS-approved investment vehicle. And as the government starts taxing crypto more aggressively, the value of tax-sheltered accounts will only increase.\n\n\n\n\n\n# 7. Crypto is Maturing, So Should Your Strategy\n\nThe early crypto era was about moonshots. Buy low, wait for a pump, cash out. But that mindset doesn’t scale. Long-term investors are looking for sustainable, strategic approaches to wealth building. A Crypto IRA represents that shift.\n\nThink about it:\n\n* Do you believe Bitcoin will be worth more in 20 years?  \n* Do you want to hedge against inflation and fiat depreciation?  \n* Do you want to minimize taxes on long-term gains?  \n\nIf the answer is yes, a Crypto IRA makes more sense than a short-term trading account. It’s the ultimate “set it and forget it” model, for people who still believe in the future of Web3.\n\n\n\n\n\n# 8. Financial Advisors Are Finally Getting On Board\n\nIn the past, most financial advisors dismissed crypto. Volatility, lack of yield, unproven tech. But today, more advisors are being trained in digital assets. They’re learning how to allocate 1–5% of portfolios to crypto. And crucially, they’re recognizing that **IRAs are the most tax-efficient way** to do it.\n\nThat’s unlocking a wave of new investment. Clients who were once kept out of the crypto game, due to regulation, compliance, or risk aversion, are now entering through retirement vehicles. Crypto IRAs are the bridge.\n\n\n\n\n\n# Final Thought: Don’t Just HODL, HODL Smart\n\nCrypto investing doesn’t have to be reckless. It can be disciplined, diversified, and tax-optimized. A Crypto IRA turns digital assets into long-term wealth tools, not just speculative plays. For anyone who truly believes in crypto’s future, this isn’t just an opportunity. It’s a necessity.\n\nIn the next 5–10 years, expect to see billions of dollars flow into Crypto IRAs as they become a core part of modern retirement planning. The infrastructure is ready. The demand is rising. And the timing couldn’t be better.\n\n",

    "body": "I’ve been saying this would happen for over a year now. And do I want to believe it’s true? Yes.\n\nWicked’s U.S. legal team can absolutely send and enforce a cease and desist letter to a UK citizen, including Elphaba Orion Doherty, especially if their actions impact the brand globally or involve platforms like TikTok, which operate internationally.\n\nThey can restrict eOD from wearing or displaying merchandise. UK law protects U.S. copyrights and trademarks through the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988, international copyright treaties, and even common law passing off, especially if eOD is misrepresenting themselves as being affiliated with or endorsed by Wicked.\n\nThe cease and desist directed at eOD appears to be based on unauthorized use of copyrighted songs like “Defying Gravity,” misrepresentation of affiliation with the brand, and use of official visuals or/and merchandise in misleading contexts.\n\nWhile I initially had doubts, the timing now makes complete sense because of TikTok’s new copyright enforcement policies. If TikTok fails to uphold copyright law, they too can face legal consequences.\n\nIt’s also important to say that using AI doesn’t invalidate legal documents. AI is widely used in formal communications, including legal letters, and this is not illegal. Legal teams regularly use AI as a tool, it doesn’t make the content or intent any less real.\n\nAt the end of the day, if this cease and desist is legitimate, it means eOD would need to stop using the name Elphaba, stop performing or posting Wicked songs, and stop wearing Wicked merchandise in her content.\n\nIf she ignores the letter and continues violating their rights on public global platforms like TikTok, especially where reputational or financial harm is involved, Wicked can escalate the matter. They could file a copyright or trademark claim under international agreements such as the Berne Convention, which both the U.S. and UK recognize. They could also request takedowns or bans on platforms like TikTok or YouTube, and if necessary, take legal action in the UK. UK courts are likely to enforce it if the case is valid.\n\nRemember, this is not drama in the reality of Wicked. Wicked plays no games when it comes to protecting their brand. They won’t confirm anything publicly due to legal confidentiality, but like any major production, they act when their rights are violated. If they move forward with a case, Wicked will win.",

This presents a challenge when smart contracts need information that exists outside the blockchain, like weather updates, [stock prices](https://worldmagzine.com/commodity/global-markets-rally-as-israel-iran-ceasefire-pushes-oil-prices-down/), or identity verification.\n\nOracles come in many forms, including software that pulls data from APIs and hardware that collects physical readings from the real [world](https://worldmagzine.com/world/). They can be centralized for simplicity or decentralized for increased security and resilience.\n\n# The Invisible Link: How Blockchain Oracles Connect Code to Reality\n\nDecentralized oracle networks (DONs) help eliminate single points of failure by combining data from multiple sources. This consensus mechanism ensures higher data accuracy and makes it harder for malicious[ actors](https://worldmagzine.com/actors/) to manipulate smart contracts through faulty inputs. Protocols like Chainlink and Band Protocol are popular in DeFi because they offer robust aggregation models and economic incentives for truthful data reporting.\n\nHardware and software oracles serve different but complementary functions. While software oracles extract digital data like price feeds or weather reports from APIs, hardware oracles bring in physical world inputs—like GPS locations or temperature—through sensors. These different types of oracles allow blockchain systems to interact with both digital and physical realities seamlessly.\n\nSome advanced oracles also support off-chain computation. Since blockchain execution can be slow and expensive, these oracles can perform complex tasks—like generating randomness, processing analytics, or computing zero-knowledge proofs—and then deliver verified results on-[chain](https://worldmagzine.com/crypto/pioneering-bitcoin-treasury-frances-blockchain-group-secures-e6m/). This opens the door for scalable and privacy-preserving applications.\n\nCross-chain oracles play an essential role in connecting multiple blockchain networks. They allow smart contracts on one chain to access or react to data and actions occurring on another. This interoperability is key to building an interconnected Web3 ecosystem, where assets, identities, and logic can move fluidly across platforms.\n\nBlockchain oracles are the unsung heroes powering the smart[ economy](https://worldmagzine.com/economy/). They enable smart contracts to interact with the real world securely, paving the way for transformative applications across industries.\n\nLearn More: [https://worldmagzine.com/crypto/blockchain-oracles-the-real-world-link-that-makes-smart-contracts-smart/](https://worldmagzine.com/crypto/blockchain-oracles-the-real-world-link-that-makes-smart-contracts-smart/)",

    "body": "Hey r/supplychain and r/logistics,\n\nIf you’re in logistics and still managing shipments, inventories, or fleet tracking with spreadsheets or siloed systems—it’s time to modernize. Implementing **Logistics IT Solutions** has been a turning point for our operations, helping us move from reactive chaos to proactive efficiency.\n\nHere’s a guide based on our recent transition for anyone thinking of upgrading their tech stack.\n\n# 🧭 1. Start with Process Mapping\n\nBefore jumping into any tool or platform, we audited our logistics processes: order management, warehouse workflows, fleet operations, customer updates. We mapped out pain points and delays (like poor visibility, slow data entry, or lack of real-time tracking).\n\n**Why it matters:** Knowing your bottlenecks ensures you select a solution that *fits*, not just one with shiny features.\n\n# 🧰 2. Choose the Right Platform(s)\n\nThere’s no one-size-fits-all. Some use standalone Transportation Management Systems (TMS), while others go with full-blown ERPs like SAP or Oracle with logistics modules. We opted for a cloud-based logistics suite that offered:\n\n* Real-time tracking\n* Inventory management\n* Route optimization\n* Integration with our CRM + warehouse systems\n\nLook for platforms with open APIs for smoother integrations!\n\n# 🔄 3. Integrate with IoT &amp; GPS\n\nWe linked our fleet vehicles and warehouse equipment with IoT sensors and GPS. This gave us real-time data on truck locations, temperature monitoring for perishables, and automated alerts for delays.\n\n**Result:** Greater transparency, faster response times, and better SLA compliance.\n\n# 🧠 4. Automate Where It Makes Sense\n\nWe introduced automation in:\n\n* Order fulfillment\n* Inventory restocking alerts\n* Shipment status notifications\n\nNot everything needs to be manual. Automating repetitive tasks freed up our team for strategic work.\n\n# 📈 5. Use Analytics to Make Smarter Decisions\n\nOur system now gives dashboards showing delivery times, route efficiency, and stock movement trends. This helped reduce late shipments by 23% in just three months. Real-time data = faster, better decisions.\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\nImplementing IT in logistics isn’t about replacing humans—it’s about giving teams the tools to **do more with less**. If you're still relying on spreadsheets, it's costing you in hidden ways (delays, errors, missed opportunities).\n\nWould love to hear from others—what tools are you using in your logistics stack? Anyone integrated AI or blockchain for tracking?\n\nLet’s swap ideas 🚛💡",

    "body": "Going into 2025, mobile apps have become a key customer touchpoint in every industry. Mobile apps are powering greater engagement, deeper insights, and more seamless operations in retail, healthcare, finance, and logistics, among many others.\n\nAs the digital economy accelerates, UK companies are seeking more mature app development partners to innovate faster and compete smarter. But with a few hundred vendors in the marketplace, how do you select the right one?\n\nTo break through the clutter, we've shortlisted the top 7 mobile app development companies in the UK that will lead the way in 2025 based on innovation, customer success, scalability, and domain expertise. \n\n# Why the Right App Development Partner Makes a Difference\n\nBefore we get into the list, let's first appreciate why the development partner you choose makes a difference.\n\nA good mobile app is not just clean code—it's strategy, user experience, security, and scalability. In 2025, UK businesses need more than coders. They need technology partners that understand industry-specific challenges and develop apps that drive measurable results.\n\nThe companies below offer not only innovative design and performance, but genuine real-world business value.\n\n# What to Expect from a Top App Development Company\n\nWhen choosing a UK mobile app development company, consider the following parameters:\n\n* Proven portfolio with startup and enterprise clientele\n* Native and cross-platform development\n* AI, IoT, and blockchain integration expertise\n* Agile software development methodology\n* Maintenance and analytics support after launch\n\nNow, let's dive into the list of leading companies that are setting the standard for mobile innovation in 2025.\n\n# 1. Appinventiv – Setting the bar for Innovation\n\nThere is a reason why Appinventiv tops this list.

    "body": "Hi r/Shopify - I'm Paul and I follow the e-commerce industry closely for my Shopifreaks E-commerce Newsletter, which I've published weekly since 2021.\n\nI was invited by the Mods of this subreddit to share my weekly e-commerce news recaps (ie: shorter versions of my full editions) to r/Shopify. Although my news recaps aren't strictly about Shopify (some weeks Shopify is covered more than others), I hope they bring value to your business no matter what platform you're on.\n\nLet's dive into this week's top stories...\n___\n**STAT OF THE WEEK:** Amazon’s emissions increased 6% in 2024 as the company builds more data centers to power its AI services.  Its total carbon emissions in 2024 reached 68.25M metric tons, marking a 6% increase from the year prior and a 33% increase from 2019, when the company launched its Climate Pledge commitment to reach net-zero emissions across its operations by 2040.\n___\n**OpenAI** is planning to take a cut from online product sales made directly through ChatGPT as the company looks to expand revenues beyond subscription fees, according to Financial Times sources. Currently ChatGPT displays products within its chatbot interface with an option to click through links to online retailers. Now it aims to integrate a checkout system into ChatGPT so that users can complete transactions within the platform and so merchants can pay a commission on those sales. Taking a cut of sales from ChatGPT would allow OpenAI to make money from free users in lieu of offering advertising, which is a group it hasn't yet been able to monetize.\n___\n**Shopify** quietly added new default language to its robots.txt file telling agentic AI bots what they can and can’t do. It reads in part, \"Checkouts are for humans. Automated scraping, ‘buy-for-me’ agents, or any end-to-end flow that completes payment without a final review step is not permitted.\" Ilya Grigorik, Shopify’s technical advisor to the CEO, later posted on X: \"This change doesn’t add or remove any rules for bots or agents. All we added is a comment for curious humans with a pointer to Checkout Kit for native integration that delivers a full-featured checkout experience.\"\n___\nIt was also revealed that **Amazon** blocked **Google's** shopping agent last week too, beginning the Agentic AI Wars. Juozas Kaziukėnas, founder of Marketplace Pulse, wrote, \"No one wants to be where the AI agents are shopping at – everyone wants to build AI agents that do the shopping. One side of the coin is the possible future of agentic shopping – systems that do shopping for us. The other side of the coin is that no one wants to be aggregated; everyone wants to be aggregator.\"\n___\n**Wix** launched its new AI Visibility Overview, a solution that enables users to understand, monitor, and actively improve how their brand appears within AI chatbots like ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity, and Claude, marking the first CMS to offer this kind of AI visibility natively. The tool allows users to track how often their website is cited by AI platforms and how much traffic originated from chatbots, stay informed on how their brand is perceived by analyzing sentiment, perception, and positioning, and compare their AI visibility performance to competitors. \n___\n**Google** is experimenting with a new ad format in Gmail that turns the Promotions tab into a mini shopping experience — because everything has to be a store now. An ad unit now appears in the Promotions tab showcasing a featured product that when clicked, expands to show multiple product tiles side-by-side with product images, name, price, star rating, and promo labels such as “Free Shipping.” The update blends Google's Demand Gen advertising with Shopping-style ads, placing e-commerce front and center in users' inboxes and allowing brands to showcase multiple products in an easy to browse format. If testing proves successful, this format could be rolled out more broadly across Gmail and potentially other Demand Gen surfaces like YouTube and Discover.\n___\n**A federal judge** dismissed a class-action lawsuit claiming **Amazon’s** addition of ads to Prime Video in 2024 amounted to a hidden price hike. U.S. District Judge Barbara J. Rothstein ruled that introducing ads was a permissible change in service benefits under Amazon’s contract, not a violation of pricing terms, because only users who opted to pay an extra $2.99 per month to remove ads experienced any price change. She noted that all subscribers agree to a contract when they join Prime that gives Amazon the ability to alter the nature of the services provided under the contract. So unfortunate! I would I have loved to see Amazon pay for this one.\n___\n**UPS** is offering voluntary buyouts to its full-time U.S. drivers amounting to $1,800 per year of service, with a minimum payout of $10,000 and no cap, in the midst of a major network overhaul to boost profitability, marking a first in the company's history. The financial incentive is in additional to earned retirement benefits like pension and healthcare. The Teamsters union, which represents more than 300,000 UPS employees, is urging members to reject the offers, calling the move an “illegal buyout offer” -- likely because they believe they can negotiate a better deal, and also to maintain control over how these types of scenarios are handled in the future.\n___\n**Delta Air Lines** launched a pilot program that uses AI to determine how much you personally will pay for a ticket, as opposed to offering static prices to all customers. The personalized pricing is currently in effect for 3% of fares, but the company aims to increase that to 20% by the end of the year. The personalized pricing is accomplished through a partnership with Fetcherr, a six-year-old Israeli company that also counts Azul, WestJet, Virgin Atlantic, and VivaAerobus as clients. Delta says that the pilot program has been “amazingly favorable,” but privacy advocates fear that it will lead to price gouging and lack of fairness and transparency.\n___\n**Amazon** quietly raised prices on thousands of low-cost staples including food, pet supplies, and cosmetics, despite previously promising that it wouldn't raise prices over tariffs, according to a Wall Street Journal study that analyzed nearly 2,500 items. Some items, like Campbell’s New England Clam Chowder, saw increases as high as 30%, but across the board, prices jumped by an average of 5%. Interestingly, many manufacturers say they haven’t increased their wholesale prices, yet their products still jumped in price significantly on Amazon, including on many U.S.-made products. Amazon defended its pricing, saying that the tracked items were not indicative of overall store trends. What's even more wild is that while the WSJ's analysis of prices found that while Amazon’s price rose on 1,200 of its cheapest household goods, **Walmart** lowered prices on the same items by nearly 2%! Did you ever think you'd live long enough for Walmart to become the good guy?\n___\n**The UK’s Financial Conduct Authority** proposed new protections for BNPL borrowers including requiring lenders to check that customers can afford to repay BNPL loans, offer borrower support if they get into financial difficulties, and allow borrowers to take complaints to the Financial Ombudsman Services. The agency argues that the proposed rules will extend to BNPL the same protections that are available for other types of lending. BNPL lenders have until Sep 26, 2025 to provide feedback on the new rules, which would take effect when BNPL comes under the regulator’s control on July 15, 2026. \n___\n**Shopify** expanded its Theme Store from 286 to 861 active themes by introducing dedicated theme cards and listing pages for each preset, allowing merchants to download themes tailored to specific industries and catalog sizes, whereas before, a theme had to showcase all of its presets within one listing. The store also now features an embedded demo store experience and improved filters for industry and catalog size, making it easier to preview and find the right theme without leaving the page. Lastly, when merchants install a theme now, they get the actual demo setup with images, sections, features installed, rather than just an empty canvas.\n___\n**Judge-me**, a popular product review app for e-commerce stores that offers simple flat rate pricing, is sunsetting its WooCommerce, Squarespace, Square, Duda, and BigCommerce apps to focus exclusively on Shopify. Peter-Jan Celis, the company's founder, shared that the move will result in the loss of only 10k out of its roughly 558k total installs, but will allow the company to gain more focus. \n___\n**Amazon Web Services** launched AgentCore, a new suite of tools for building AI agents that can automate multi-step tasks and autonomously complete complex actions with minimal human intervention. AgentCore also integrates with the AWS Marketplace, enabling teams to deploy pre-built agents and tools. The move places AWS in direct competition with Salesforce, OpenAI, and Google in the agentic AI space. \n___\n**Mark Zuckerberg** and other current and former Meta executives reached an undisclosed settlement in a lawsuit seeking $8B in damages for allegedly allowing repeated privacy violations on Facebook. The lawsuit alleged that Meta leadership failed to oversee the company's compliance with a 2012 FTC agreement to protect user data and claimed that they knowingly ran Facebook as an illegal data harvesting operation, which led to a $5B FTC fine in 2019. The trial was halted on its second day just before key testimonies from Mark Zuckerberg, Marc Andreessen, and Sheryl Sandberg were set to begin.\n___\n**67% of back-to-school shoppers** have already begun purchasing items for the upcoming school year as of early July out of concern that prices will rise due to tariffs, according to a survey by the National Retail Federation and Prosper Insights &amp; Analytics. The early start is up from 55% last year and is the highest since NRF started tracking early shopping in 2018. Despite getting a head start on some supplies, 84% of parents indicated that they still have at least half of their purchases left to complete because they are waiting for the best deals (47%), do not yet know what items are needed (39%), or are planning to spread out their budgets (24%).\n___\n**eBay** is testing a new listing feature that displays the median sold price for trading cards over the past 90 days, causing fear amongst sellers that incorrect data will artificially drive down prices. The median sold price appears right above the Buy It Now button and could potentially influence buyers to submit lowball offers based on pricing data aggregated by cheaper, lower-condition sales of similar items. Sellers are criticizing the test for failing to account for key differentiators like card condition or grading, which can drastically affect value.\n___\n**Brett Lemieux**, founder of Mister ManCave, ignited what may be the largest sports memorabilia fraud scandal in history, claiming to have profited over $350M from counterfeit memorabilia sales and naming co-conspirators, before taking his own life. Sports Collectors Daily called the scheme a “wake-up call” to memorabilia collectors. The Shopify website for Mister Mancave is still active with items available for sale, but Lemieux's Amazon and eBay stores were taken down after the news broke.\n___\n**Chile** partnered with 30 institutions across Latin America and the Caribbean to create Latam-GPT, an open-source large language model that is being trained by locals who take language and cultural nuances into account. The project led by Héctor Bravo says it is “building AI in Latin America, for Latin Americans” and aims to redefine success metrics — “not just accuracy or speed but cultural representation, social impact, and accessibility.” Latam-GPT includes Indigenous languages such as Nahuatl, Quechua, and Mapudungun, as well as dialect variants, including some from the Caribbean.\n___\n**Coinbase** unveiled an “everything app” called Base App that replaces Coinbase Wallet and combines trading, payments, messaging, social media, and mini apps, powered by its in-house blockchain, Base. It also introduced Base Pay, a one-click USDC checkout developed with Shopify, and Base Account for identity verification. The move aims to bring more non-trading people into the crypto economy and position Coinbase as a super app like WeChat or Alipay. Seems good in theory, but are people really going to be like, “Hey follow and DM me on Coinbase”? It feels a bit too “Dunder Mifflin Infinity-ish” to me.\n___\n**Elon Musk's AI startup xAI** secured a $200M contract with the U.S. Department of Defense, announced just days after public controversy over antisemitic output produced by the company's Grok chatbot. As part of its agreement with the government, xAI presented “Grok for Government,” a new initiative to develop tailored AI applications for public sector needs like healthcare, national security, and other essential services. The Department of Defense also announced that it had signed similar $200M agreements with Google, Anthropic, and OpenAI, giving the Pentagon simultaneous access to multiple AI models and workflows. \n___\n**eBay** is adding AI-generated content to the coveted top section of sellers' listings, according to a screenshot shared by a user on its discussion boards and confirmed by EcommerceBytes. The seller that posted the screenshot sarcastically noted, “By the way, one ice maker I looked at had an AI notation: Great for making ice. It's that sort of extra information that makes AI so invaluable.” Another commentor shared that a fabric she sells with fruit designs on it had an AI-generated description that said “delicious to eat.” But yeah, let's use AI to power wars.\n___\n**Meta** hired Mark Lee and Tom Gunter, a pair of key AI researchers who worked at Apple, for its Superintelligence Labs team. Lee has already started at Meta after leaving Apple a few days ago, while Gunter will begin work in the near future. Meta also appointed Connor Hayes, who's previously held several key roles at the company, as the new head of Threads\n___\n**Scale AI**, the Meta-backed AI data labeling company that recently faced embarrassment when it was revealed that they were using public Google Docs to track work for high-profile customers, is laying off 14% of its workforce, or about 200 employees, after the CEO says it “we ramped up our GenAI capacity too quickly over the past year.” In reality, the company lost several key clients including Google, OpenAI, Microsoft, and xAI after Meta's recent investment.\n___\n**In other layoffs / departures this week…** **Amazon** laid off several hundred employees across its AWS division, **Reddit** CMO Roxy Young is departing the company after more than eight years, and **Starbucks** upped its return-to-office requirement for corporate employees to four days from three — which is effectively another round of silent layoffs. I paid $4.55 for an Americano yesterday (just arrived back to the U.S. after more than a year and didn't realize prices had shot up so much) and Starbucks thinks work-from-home employees is the problem they're facing? That'll be my last Starbucks visit this trip guys.\n___\n**Amazon's smart home division** is now requiring employees seeking promotions to prove that they use AI in their jobs and are accomplishing “more with less” using the technology, as part of a new policy announced by Ring founder and division head Jamie Siminoff. The change comes two months after Siminoff returned to Amazon, replacing former division leader Liz Hamren, and amid a broader push by CEO Andy Jassy to rid itself of useless humans embrace AI and re-embrace the company's startup roots. Weren't Ring doorbells recently hacked? Thanks AI!\n___\n**Every major e-commerce platform** posted negative YoY growth in Q2 2025, as shared by Malte Karstan. Shopware is down -44.2%, WooCommerce -18.5% and Shopify dropped -9.1%, while the total market shrank -17.2% across the top 1M sites, according to data from BuiltWith. Karstan attributes the drop not to demand crashing, but to how brands are restructuring their digital infrastructure such as replatforming toward headless, composable, or custom stacks or consolidating platforms, as well as the market stabilizing after explosive growth during 2020-2022.\n___\n**Temu** launched its previously invitation-only Local Seller Program to all sellers in Australia, allowing Australian-registered businesses with locally stocked inventory to list their products on the platform. Temu launched in the U.S. in September 2022 and entered the Australian market in March 2023. Currently sellers in over 20 countries including the U.S., Canada, UK, Germany, Japan, and South Korea have joined the Local Seller Program in their respective markets. \n___\n**Microsoft** abruptly ended new movie and TV purchases on its Xbox and Windows platforms, closing the Movies &amp; TV store as of July 18, 2025. Users can still access and download previously purchased content via the Movies &amp; TV app, but no refunds are being offered. The move ends a nearly 20-year media sales run that began with Zune Marketplace in 2006, followed with Xbox Video, and subsequently concluded with their Movies &amp; TV app. Microsoft is now leaving video content on Windows and Xbox entirely to third-party platforms like Amazon, Apple TV, and Netflix.\n___\n**Consentik**, a Shopify plugin meant to safeguard privacy, quietly exposed hundreds of online stores to data theft, full account takeover, and hijacked ad spend for over 100 days. The flaw turned out to be an unsecured Kafka server that broadcast sensitive data in real-time without a password or firewall. The leaked Shopify tokens could give bad actors complete admin access to stores, allowing them to change prices, access customer data, inject malicious code, and more. Neither Shopify or Omegatheme, the maker of the app, have made an official statement about the breach.\n___\n**The Competition Commission of Pakistan** launched an investigation into Temu for allegedly engaging in misleading and anti-competitive practices that are distorting the local market by offering artificially low prices while avoiding taxes and import duties. Last week I reported that Temu, which only entered the Pakistani market a few months ago, raised prices for customers in Pakistan by up to 300% following the government's decision to impose new taxes on online sellers. Temu is off to a rocky start in Pakistan!\n___\n**Snapchat** is delivering stronger returns on ad spend than larger platforms, particularly for fashion and e-commerce advertisers, according to a new study by Snap and Triple Whale. The report analyzed $3B in ad spend across 20,000 brands and found Snapchat's ROAS increased 7.5% while others declined, and it recorded the lowest cost per acquisition of all measured platforms. Wow, what are the odds that a Snap-led study revealed that Snapchat offers the best ad platform? Even though the report is a bit biased, I'm including the news this week because it's interesting to see the Snapchat advertising insights offered in the study.\n___\n**Christine Hunsicker**, the founder of clothing-rental company CaaStle, was arrested Friday on federal fraud charges accusing her of cheating investors out of $300M by making false revenue projections and falsely claiming to have hundreds of millions of dollars in cash on hand, when in truth, the company was nearing collapse. She's also accused of attempting to raise new capital, even after CaaStle's board removed her as chair and prohibited her from soliciting investments. Damn, that's almost as embarrassing as getting caught cheating on your wife at a Coldplay concert!\n___\n**🏆 This week's most ridiculous story…** Reddit announced that it will begin verifying the ages of users in the UK before they can view NSFW subreddits by — get this — having them upload a selfie! O-face not required. 😂 The rule change is in response to the UK Online Safety Act coming into effect this month, which requires all platforms that host certain adult content to establish an age verification system by July 24th. Reddit partnered with Persona, a third-party age verification provider, which will require UK users to upload either a selfie or their government ID, which Persona will use to verify that they are over 18. Meta is also taking similar moves. Wow, great idea! What could possibly go wrong? (In the full edition, I linked to a story showcasing how ID verification can sometimes go VERY wrong!)\n___\nPlus 13 seed rounds, IPOs, and acquisitions of interest including **Lovable**, a Swedish AI startup that lets users build web apps by describing them in natural language using a technique called “vibe coding,” raising $200M in a Series A round led by Accel at a $1.8B valuation.\n___\nI hope you found this recap helpful. See you next week!\n\nPAUL\n\nPS: If I missed any big news this week, please share in the comments.",

      "The Judge-me news is pretty interesting in particular. I think it would lead to even more apps focusing solely on just Shopify which in turn would keep on improving the average quality of apps on the platform.\nThe Open AI one also caught my attention. That would be a huge move if they do go ahead with it and I wonder how it will be implemented"

    "body": "Hi r/ShopifyeCommerce - I'm Paul and I follow the e-commerce industry closely for my Shopifreaks E-commerce Newsletter. Every week for the past 4 years I've posted a summary recap of the week's top stories on this subreddit, which I cover in depth with sources in the full edition. Let's dive in to this week's top e-commerce news...\n___\n**STAT OF THE WEEK:** Amazon’s emissions increased 6% in 2024 as the company builds more data centers to power its AI services.  Its total carbon emissions in 2024 reached 68.25M metric tons, marking a 6% increase from the year prior and a 33% increase from 2019, when the company launched its Climate Pledge commitment to reach net-zero emissions across its operations by 2040.\n___\n**OpenAI** is planning to take a cut from online product sales made directly through ChatGPT as the company looks to expand revenues beyond subscription fees, according to Financial Times sources. Currently ChatGPT displays products within its chatbot interface with an option to click through links to online retailers. Now it aims to integrate a checkout system into ChatGPT so that users can complete transactions within the platform and so merchants can pay a commission on those sales. Taking a cut of sales from ChatGPT would allow OpenAI to make money from free users in lieu of offering advertising, which is a group it hasn't yet been able to monetize.\n___\n**Shopify** quietly added new default language to its robots.txt file telling agentic AI bots what they can and can’t do. It reads in part, \"Checkouts are for humans. Automated scraping, ‘buy-for-me’ agents, or any end-to-end flow that completes payment without a final review step is not permitted.\" Ilya Grigorik, Shopify’s technical advisor to the CEO, later posted on X: \"This change doesn’t add or remove any rules for bots or agents. All we added is a comment for curious humans with a pointer to Checkout Kit for native integration that delivers a full-featured checkout experience.\"\n___\nIt was also revealed that **Amazon** blocked **Google's** shopping agent last week too, beginning the Agentic AI Wars. Juozas Kaziukėnas, founder of Marketplace Pulse, wrote, \"No one wants to be where the AI agents are shopping at – everyone wants to build AI agents that do the shopping. One side of the coin is the possible future of agentic shopping – systems that do shopping for us. The other side of the coin is that no one wants to be aggregated; everyone wants to be aggregator.\"\n___\n**Wix** launched its new AI Visibility Overview, a solution that enables users to understand, monitor, and actively improve how their brand appears within AI chatbots like ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity, and Claude, marking the first CMS to offer this kind of AI visibility natively. The tool allows users to track how often their website is cited by AI platforms and how much traffic originated from chatbots, stay informed on how their brand is perceived by analyzing sentiment, perception, and positioning, and compare their AI visibility performance to competitors. \n___\n**Google** is experimenting with a new ad format in Gmail that turns the Promotions tab into a mini shopping experience — because everything has to be a store now. An ad unit now appears in the Promotions tab showcasing a featured product that when clicked, expands to show multiple product tiles side-by-side with product images, name, price, star rating, and promo labels such as “Free Shipping.” The update blends Google's Demand Gen advertising with Shopping-style ads, placing e-commerce front and center in users' inboxes and allowing brands to showcase multiple products in an easy to browse format. If testing proves successful, this format could be rolled out more broadly across Gmail and potentially other Demand Gen surfaces like YouTube and Discover.\n___\n**A federal judge** dismissed a class-action lawsuit claiming **Amazon’s** addition of ads to Prime Video in 2024 amounted to a hidden price hike. U.S. District Judge Barbara J. Rothstein ruled that introducing ads was a permissible change in service benefits under Amazon’s contract, not a violation of pricing terms, because only users who opted to pay an extra $2.99 per month to remove ads experienced any price change. She noted that all subscribers agree to a contract when they join Prime that gives Amazon the ability to alter the nature of the services provided under the contract. So unfortunate! I would I have loved to see Amazon pay for this one.\n___\n**UPS** is offering voluntary buyouts to its full-time U.S. drivers amounting to $1,800 per year of service, with a minimum payout of $10,000 and no cap, in the midst of a major network overhaul to boost profitability, marking a first in the company's history. The financial incentive is in additional to earned retirement benefits like pension and healthcare. The Teamsters union, which represents more than 300,000 UPS employees, is urging members to reject the offers, calling the move an “illegal buyout offer” -- likely because they believe they can negotiate a better deal, and also to maintain control over how these types of scenarios are handled in the future.\n___\n**Delta Air Lines** launched a pilot program that uses AI to determine how much you personally will pay for a ticket, as opposed to offering static prices to all customers. The personalized pricing is currently in effect for 3% of fares, but the company aims to increase that to 20% by the end of the year. The personalized pricing is accomplished through a partnership with Fetcherr, a six-year-old Israeli company that also counts Azul, WestJet, Virgin Atlantic, and VivaAerobus as clients. Delta says that the pilot program has been “amazingly favorable,” but privacy advocates fear that it will lead to price gouging and lack of fairness and transparency.\n___\n**Amazon** quietly raised prices on thousands of low-cost staples including food, pet supplies, and cosmetics, despite previously promising that it wouldn't raise prices over tariffs, according to a Wall Street Journal study that analyzed nearly 2,500 items. Some items, like Campbell’s New England Clam Chowder, saw increases as high as 30%, but across the board, prices jumped by an average of 5%. Interestingly, many manufacturers say they haven’t increased their wholesale prices, yet their products still jumped in price significantly on Amazon, including on many U.S.-made products. Amazon defended its pricing, saying that the tracked items were not indicative of overall store trends. What's even more wild is that while the WSJ's analysis of prices found that while Amazon’s price rose on 1,200 of its cheapest household goods, **Walmart** lowered prices on the same items by nearly 2%! Did you ever think you'd live long enough for Walmart to become the good guy?\n___\n**The UK’s Financial Conduct Authority** proposed new protections for BNPL borrowers including requiring lenders to check that customers can afford to repay BNPL loans, offer borrower support if they get into financial difficulties, and allow borrowers to take complaints to the Financial Ombudsman Services. The agency argues that the proposed rules will extend to BNPL the same protections that are available for other types of lending. BNPL lenders have until Sep 26, 2025 to provide feedback on the new rules, which would take effect when BNPL comes under the regulator’s control on July 15, 2026. \n___\n**Shopify** expanded its Theme Store from 286 to 861 active themes by introducing dedicated theme cards and listing pages for each preset, allowing merchants to download themes tailored to specific industries and catalog sizes, whereas before, a theme had to showcase all of its presets within one listing. The store also now features an embedded demo store experience and improved filters for industry and catalog size, making it easier to preview and find the right theme without leaving the page. Lastly, when merchants install a theme now, they get the actual demo setup with images, sections, features installed, rather than just an empty canvas.\n___\n**Judge-me**, a popular product review app for e-commerce stores that offers simple flat rate pricing, is sunsetting its WooCommerce, Squarespace, Square, Duda, and BigCommerce apps to focus exclusively on Shopify. Peter-Jan Celis, the company's founder, shared that the move will result in the loss of only 10k out of its roughly 558k total installs, but will allow the company to gain more focus. \n___\n**Amazon Web Services** launched AgentCore, a new suite of tools for building AI agents that can automate multi-step tasks and autonomously complete complex actions with minimal human intervention. AgentCore also integrates with the AWS Marketplace, enabling teams to deploy pre-built agents and tools. The move places AWS in direct competition with Salesforce, OpenAI, and Google in the agentic AI space. \n___\n**Mark Zuckerberg** and other current and former Meta executives reached an undisclosed settlement in a lawsuit seeking $8B in damages for allegedly allowing repeated privacy violations on Facebook. The lawsuit alleged that Meta leadership failed to oversee the company's compliance with a 2012 FTC agreement to protect user data and claimed that they knowingly ran Facebook as an illegal data harvesting operation, which led to a $5B FTC fine in 2019. The trial was halted on its second day just before key testimonies from Mark Zuckerberg, Marc Andreessen, and Sheryl Sandberg were set to begin.\n___\n**67% of back-to-school shoppers** have already begun purchasing items for the upcoming school year as of early July out of concern that prices will rise due to tariffs, according to a survey by the National Retail Federation and Prosper Insights &amp; Analytics. The early start is up from 55% last year and is the highest since NRF started tracking early shopping in 2018. Despite getting a head start on some supplies, 84% of parents indicated that they still have at least half of their purchases left to complete because they are waiting for the best deals (47%), do not yet know what items are needed (39%), or are planning to spread out their budgets (24%).\n___\n**eBay** is testing a new listing feature that displays the median sold price for trading cards over the past 90 days, causing fear amongst sellers that incorrect data will artificially drive down prices. The median sold price appears right above the Buy It Now button and could potentially influence buyers to submit lowball offers based on pricing data aggregated by cheaper, lower-condition sales of similar items. Sellers are criticizing the test for failing to account for key differentiators like card condition or grading, which can drastically affect value.\n___\n**Brett Lemieux**, founder of Mister ManCave, ignited what may be the largest sports memorabilia fraud scandal in history, claiming to have profited over $350M from counterfeit memorabilia sales and naming co-conspirators, before taking his own life. Sports Collectors Daily called the scheme a “wake-up call” to memorabilia collectors. The Shopify website for Mister Mancave is still active with items available for sale, but Lemieux's Amazon and eBay stores were taken down after the news broke.\n___\n**Chile** partnered with 30 institutions across Latin America and the Caribbean to create Latam-GPT, an open-source large language model that is being trained by locals who take language and cultural nuances into account. The project led by Héctor Bravo says it is “building AI in Latin America, for Latin Americans” and aims to redefine success metrics — “not just accuracy or speed but cultural representation, social impact, and accessibility.” Latam-GPT includes Indigenous languages such as Nahuatl, Quechua, and Mapudungun, as well as dialect variants, including some from the Caribbean.\n___\n**Coinbase** unveiled an “everything app” called Base App that replaces Coinbase Wallet and combines trading, payments, messaging, social media, and mini apps, powered by its in-house blockchain, Base. It also introduced Base Pay, a one-click USDC checkout developed with Shopify, and Base Account for identity verification. The move aims to bring more non-trading people into the crypto economy and position Coinbase as a super app like WeChat or Alipay. Seems good in theory, but are people really going to be like, “Hey follow and DM me on Coinbase”? It feels a bit too “Dunder Mifflin Infinity-ish” to me.\n___\n**Elon Musk's AI startup xAI** secured a $200M contract with the U.S. Department of Defense, announced just days after public controversy over antisemitic output produced by the company's Grok chatbot. As part of its agreement with the government, xAI presented “Grok for Government,” a new initiative to develop tailored AI applications for public sector needs like healthcare, national security, and other essential services. The Department of Defense also announced that it had signed similar $200M agreements with Google, Anthropic, and OpenAI, giving the Pentagon simultaneous access to multiple AI models and workflows. \n___\n**eBay** is adding AI-generated content to the coveted top section of sellers' listings, according to a screenshot shared by a user on its discussion boards and confirmed by EcommerceBytes. The seller that posted the screenshot sarcastically noted, “By the way, one ice maker I looked at had an AI notation: Great for making ice. It's that sort of extra information that makes AI so invaluable.” Another commentor shared that a fabric she sells with fruit designs on it had an AI-generated description that said “delicious to eat.” But yeah, let's use AI to power wars.\n___\n**Meta** hired Mark Lee and Tom Gunter, a pair of key AI researchers who worked at Apple, for its Superintelligence Labs team. Lee has already started at Meta after leaving Apple a few days ago, while Gunter will begin work in the near future. Meta also appointed Connor Hayes, who's previously held several key roles at the company, as the new head of Threads\n___\n**Scale AI**, the Meta-backed AI data labeling company that recently faced embarrassment when it was revealed that they were using public Google Docs to track work for high-profile customers, is laying off 14% of its workforce, or about 200 employees, after the CEO says it “we ramped up our GenAI capacity too quickly over the past year.” In reality, the company lost several key clients including Google, OpenAI, Microsoft, and xAI after Meta's recent investment.\n___\n**In other layoffs / departures this week…** **Amazon** laid off several hundred employees across its AWS division, **Reddit** CMO Roxy Young is departing the company after more than eight years, and **Starbucks** upped its return-to-office requirement for corporate employees to four days from three — which is effectively another round of silent layoffs. I paid $4.55 for an Americano yesterday (just arrived back to the U.S. after more than a year and didn't realize prices had shot up so much) and Starbucks thinks work-from-home employees is the problem they're facing? That'll be my last Starbucks visit this trip guys.\n___\n**Amazon's smart home division** is now requiring employees seeking promotions to prove that they use AI in their jobs and are accomplishing “more with less” using the technology, as part of a new policy announced by Ring founder and division head Jamie Siminoff. The change comes two months after Siminoff returned to Amazon, replacing former division leader Liz Hamren, and amid a broader push by CEO Andy Jassy to rid itself of useless humans embrace AI and re-embrace the company's startup roots. Weren't Ring doorbells recently hacked? Thanks AI!\n___\n**Every major e-commerce platform** posted negative YoY growth in Q2 2025, as shared by Malte Karstan. Shopware is down -44.2%, WooCommerce -18.5% and Shopify dropped -9.1%, while the total market shrank -17.2% across the top 1M sites, according to data from BuiltWith. Karstan attributes the drop not to demand crashing, but to how brands are restructuring their digital infrastructure such as replatforming toward headless, composable, or custom stacks or consolidating platforms, as well as the market stabilizing after explosive growth during 2020-2022.\n___\n**Temu** launched its previously invitation-only Local Seller Program to all sellers in Australia, allowing Australian-registered businesses with locally stocked inventory to list their products on the platform. Temu launched in the U.S. in September 2022 and entered the Australian market in March 2023. Currently sellers in over 20 countries including the U.S., Canada, UK, Germany, Japan, and South Korea have joined the Local Seller Program in their respective markets. \n___\n**Microsoft** abruptly ended new movie and TV purchases on its Xbox and Windows platforms, closing the Movies &amp; TV store as of July 18, 2025. Users can still access and download previously purchased content via the Movies &amp; TV app, but no refunds are being offered. The move ends a nearly 20-year media sales run that began with Zune Marketplace in 2006, followed with Xbox Video, and subsequently concluded with their Movies &amp; TV app. Microsoft is now leaving video content on Windows and Xbox entirely to third-party platforms like Amazon, Apple TV, and Netflix.\n___\n**Consentik**, a Shopify plugin meant to safeguard privacy, quietly exposed hundreds of online stores to data theft, full account takeover, and hijacked ad spend for over 100 days. The flaw turned out to be an unsecured Kafka server that broadcast sensitive data in real-time without a password or firewall. The leaked Shopify tokens could give bad actors complete admin access to stores, allowing them to change prices, access customer data, inject malicious code, and more. Neither Shopify or Omegatheme, the maker of the app, have made an official statement about the breach.\n___\n**The Competition Commission of Pakistan** launched an investigation into Temu for allegedly engaging in misleading and anti-competitive practices that are distorting the local market by offering artificially low prices while avoiding taxes and import duties. Last week I reported that Temu, which only entered the Pakistani market a few months ago, raised prices for customers in Pakistan by up to 300% following the government's decision to impose new taxes on online sellers. Temu is off to a rocky start in Pakistan!\n___\n**Snapchat** is delivering stronger returns on ad spend than larger platforms, particularly for fashion and e-commerce advertisers, according to a new study by Snap and Triple Whale. The report analyzed $3B in ad spend across 20,000 brands and found Snapchat's ROAS increased 7.5% while others declined, and it recorded the lowest cost per acquisition of all measured platforms. Wow, what are the odds that a Snap-led study revealed that Snapchat offers the best ad platform? Even though the report is a bit biased, I'm including the news this week because it's interesting to see the Snapchat advertising insights offered in the study.\n___\n**Christine Hunsicker**, the founder of clothing-rental company CaaStle, was arrested Friday on federal fraud charges accusing her of cheating investors out of $300M by making false revenue projections and falsely claiming to have hundreds of millions of dollars in cash on hand, when in truth, the company was nearing collapse. She's also accused of attempting to raise new capital, even after CaaStle's board removed her as chair and prohibited her from soliciting investments. Damn, that's almost as embarrassing as getting caught cheating on your wife at a Coldplay concert!\n___\n**🏆 This week's most ridiculous story…** Reddit announced that it will begin verifying the ages of users in the UK before they can view NSFW subreddits by — get this — having them upload a selfie! O-face not required. 😂 The rule change is in response to the UK Online Safety Act coming into effect this month, which requires all platforms that host certain adult content to establish an age verification system by July 24th. Reddit partnered with Persona, a third-party age verification provider, which will require UK users to upload either a selfie or their government ID, which Persona will use to verify that they are over 18. Meta is also taking similar moves. Wow, great idea! What could possibly go wrong? (In the full edition, I linked to a story showcasing how ID verification can sometimes go VERY wrong!)\n___\nPlus 13 seed rounds, IPOs, and acquisitions of interest including **Lovable**, a Swedish AI startup that lets users build web apps by describing them in natural language using a technique called “vibe coding,” raising $200M in a Series A round led by Accel at a $1.8B valuation.\n___\nI hope you found this recap helpful. See you next week!\n\nFor more details on each story and sources, see the full edition:\n\nhttps://www.shopifreaks.com/chatgpts-squeeze-agentic-ai-wars-gmail-shopping/\n\n**What else is new in e-commerce?**\n\nShare stories of interesting in the comments below (including in your own business) or on r/Shopifreaks/.\n\n-PAUL\n\nPS: Want the full editions delivered to your Inbox each week?

    "body": "Hi r/ecommerce \\- I'm Paul and I follow the e-commerce industry closely for my Shopifreaks E-commerce Newsletter. Every week for the past 4 years I've posted a summary recap of the week's top stories on this subreddit, which I cover in depth with sources in the full edition. Let's dive in to this week's top e-commerce news...\n___\n**STAT OF THE WEEK:** Amazon’s emissions increased 6% in 2024 as the company builds more data centers to power its AI services.  Its total carbon emissions in 2024 reached 68.25M metric tons, marking a 6% increase from the year prior and a 33% increase from 2019, when the company launched its Climate Pledge commitment to reach net-zero emissions across its operations by 2040.\n___\n**OpenAI** is planning to take a cut from online product sales made directly through ChatGPT as the company looks to expand revenues beyond subscription fees, according to Financial Times sources. Currently ChatGPT displays products within its chatbot interface with an option to click through links to online retailers. Now it aims to integrate a checkout system into ChatGPT so that users can complete transactions within the platform and so merchants can pay a commission on those sales. Taking a cut of sales from ChatGPT would allow OpenAI to make money from free users in lieu of offering advertising, which is a group it hasn't yet been able to monetize.\n___\n**Shopify** quietly added new default language to its robots.txt file telling agentic AI bots what they can and can’t do. It reads in part, \"Checkouts are for humans. Automated scraping, ‘buy-for-me’ agents, or any end-to-end flow that completes payment without a final review step is not permitted.\" Ilya Grigorik, Shopify’s technical advisor to the CEO, later posted on X: \"This change doesn’t add or remove any rules for bots or agents. All we added is a comment for curious humans with a pointer to Checkout Kit for native integration that delivers a full-featured checkout experience.\"\n___\nIt was also revealed that **Amazon** blocked **Google's** shopping agent last week too, beginning the Agentic AI Wars. Juozas Kaziukėnas, founder of Marketplace Pulse, wrote, \"No one wants to be where the AI agents are shopping at – everyone wants to build AI agents that do the shopping. One side of the coin is the possible future of agentic shopping – systems that do shopping for us. The other side of the coin is that no one wants to be aggregated; everyone wants to be aggregator.\"\n___\n**Wix** launched its new AI Visibility Overview, a solution that enables users to understand, monitor, and actively improve how their brand appears within AI chatbots like ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity, and Claude, marking the first CMS to offer this kind of AI visibility natively. The tool allows users to track how often their website is cited by AI platforms and how much traffic originated from chatbots, stay informed on how their brand is perceived by analyzing sentiment, perception, and positioning, and compare their AI visibility performance to competitors. \n___\n**Google** is experimenting with a new ad format in Gmail that turns the Promotions tab into a mini shopping experience — because everything has to be a store now.

If testing proves successful, this format could be rolled out more broadly across Gmail and potentially other Demand Gen surfaces like YouTube and Discover.\n___\n**A federal judge** dismissed a class-action lawsuit claiming **Amazon’s** addition of ads to Prime Video in 2024 amounted to a hidden price hike. U.S. District Judge Barbara J. Rothstein ruled that introducing ads was a permissible change in service benefits under Amazon’s contract, not a violation of pricing terms, because only users who opted to pay an extra $2.99 per month to remove ads experienced any price change. She noted that all subscribers agree to a contract when they join Prime that gives Amazon the ability to alter the nature of the services provided under the contract. So unfortunate! I would I have loved to see Amazon pay for this one.\n___\n**UPS** is offering voluntary buyouts to its full-time U.S. drivers amounting to $1,800 per year of service, with a minimum payout of $10,000 and no cap, in the midst of a major network overhaul to boost profitability, marking a first in the company's history. The financial incentive is in additional to earned retirement benefits like pension and healthcare. The Teamsters union, which represents more than 300,000 UPS employees, is urging members to reject the offers, calling the move an “illegal buyout offer” -- likely because they believe they can negotiate a better deal, and also to maintain control over how these types of scenarios are handled in the future.\n___\n**Delta Air Lines** launched a pilot program that uses AI to determine how much you personally will pay for a ticket, as opposed to offering static prices to all customers. The personalized pricing is currently in effect for 3% of fares, but the company aims to increase that to 20% by the end of the year. The personalized pricing is accomplished through a partnership with Fetcherr, a six-year-old Israeli company that also counts Azul, WestJet, Virgin Atlantic, and VivaAerobus as clients. Delta says that the pilot program has been “amazingly favorable,” but privacy advocates fear that it will lead to price gouging and lack of fairness and transparency.\n___\n**Amazon** quietly raised prices on thousands of low-cost staples including food, pet supplies, and cosmetics, despite previously promising that it wouldn't raise prices over tariffs, according to a Wall Street Journal study that analyzed nearly 2,500 items. Some items, like Campbell’s New England Clam Chowder, saw increases as high as 30%, but across the board, prices jumped by an average of 5%. Interestingly, many manufacturers say they haven’t increased their wholesale prices, yet their products still jumped in price significantly on Amazon, including on many U.S.-made products. Amazon defended its pricing, saying that the tracked items were not indicative of overall store trends. What's even more wild is that while the WSJ's analysis of prices found that while Amazon’s price rose on 1,200 of its cheapest household goods, **Walmart** lowered prices on the same items by nearly 2%! Did you ever think you'd live long enough for Walmart to become the good guy?\n___\n**The UK’s Financial Conduct Authority** proposed new protections for BNPL borrowers including requiring lenders to check that customers can afford to repay BNPL loans, offer borrower support if they get into financial difficulties, and allow borrowers to take complaints to the Financial Ombudsman Services. The agency argues that the proposed rules will extend to BNPL the same protections that are available for other types of lending. BNPL lenders have until Sep 26, 2025 to provide feedback on the new rules, which would take effect when BNPL comes under the regulator’s control on July 15, 2026. \n___\n**Shopify** expanded its Theme Store from 286 to 861 active themes by introducing dedicated theme cards and listing pages for each preset, allowing merchants to download themes tailored to specific industries and catalog sizes, whereas before, a theme had to showcase all of its presets within one listing. The store also now features an embedded demo store experience and improved filters for industry and catalog size, making it easier to preview and find the right theme without leaving the page. Lastly, when merchants install a theme now, they get the actual demo setup with images, sections, features installed, rather than just an empty canvas.\n___\n**Judge-me**, a popular product review app for e-commerce stores that offers simple flat rate pricing, is sunsetting its WooCommerce, Squarespace, Square, Duda, and BigCommerce apps to focus exclusively on Shopify. Peter-Jan Celis, the company's founder, shared that the move will result in the loss of only 10k out of its roughly 558k total installs, but will allow the company to gain more focus. \n___\n**Amazon Web Services** launched AgentCore, a new suite of tools for building AI agents that can automate multi-step tasks and autonomously complete complex actions with minimal human intervention. AgentCore also integrates with the AWS Marketplace, enabling teams to deploy pre-built agents and tools. The move places AWS in direct competition with Salesforce, OpenAI, and Google in the agentic AI space. \n___\n**Mark Zuckerberg** and other current and former Meta executives reached an undisclosed settlement in a lawsuit seeking $8B in damages for allegedly allowing repeated privacy violations on Facebook. The lawsuit alleged that Meta leadership failed to oversee the company's compliance with a 2012 FTC agreement to protect user data and claimed that they knowingly ran Facebook as an illegal data harvesting operation, which led to a $5B FTC fine in 2019. The trial was halted on its second day just before key testimonies from Mark Zuckerberg, Marc Andreessen, and Sheryl Sandberg were set to begin.\n___\n**67% of back-to-school shoppers** have already begun purchasing items for the upcoming school year as of early July out of concern that prices will rise due to tariffs, according to a survey by the National Retail Federation and Prosper Insights &amp; Analytics. The early start is up from 55% last year and is the highest since NRF started tracking early shopping in 2018. Despite getting a head start on some supplies, 84% of parents indicated that they still have at least half of their purchases left to complete because they are waiting for the best deals (47%), do not yet know what items are needed (39%), or are planning to spread out their budgets (24%).\n___\n**eBay** is testing a new listing feature that displays the median sold price for trading cards over the past 90 days, causing fear amongst sellers that incorrect data will artificially drive down prices. The median sold price appears right above the Buy It Now button and could potentially influence buyers to submit lowball offers based on pricing data aggregated by cheaper, lower-condition sales of similar items. Sellers are criticizing the test for failing to account for key differentiators like card condition or grading, which can drastically affect value.\n___\n**Brett Lemieux**, founder of Mister ManCave, ignited what may be the largest sports memorabilia fraud scandal in history, claiming to have profited over $350M from counterfeit memorabilia sales and naming co-conspirators, before taking his own life. Sports Collectors Daily called the scheme a “wake-up call” to memorabilia collectors. The Shopify website for Mister Mancave is still active with items available for sale, but Lemieux's Amazon and eBay stores were taken down after the news broke.\n___\n**Chile** partnered with 30 institutions across Latin America and the Caribbean to create Latam-GPT, an open-source large language model that is being trained by locals who take language and cultural nuances into account. The project led by Héctor Bravo says it is “building AI in Latin America, for Latin Americans” and aims to redefine success metrics — “not just accuracy or speed but cultural representation, social impact, and accessibility.” Latam-GPT includes Indigenous languages such as Nahuatl, Quechua, and Mapudungun, as well as dialect variants, including some from the Caribbean.\n___\n**Coinbase** unveiled an “everything app” called Base App that replaces Coinbase Wallet and combines trading, payments, messaging, social media, and mini apps, powered by its in-house blockchain, Base. It also introduced Base Pay, a one-click USDC checkout developed with Shopify, and Base Account for identity verification. The move aims to bring more non-trading people into the crypto economy and position Coinbase as a super app like WeChat or Alipay. Seems good in theory, but are people really going to be like, “Hey follow and DM me on Coinbase”? It feels a bit too “Dunder Mifflin Infinity-ish” to me.\n___\n**Elon Musk's AI startup xAI** secured a $200M contract with the U.S. Department of Defense, announced just days after public controversy over antisemitic output produced by the company's Grok chatbot. As part of its agreement with the government, xAI presented “Grok for Government,” a new initiative to develop tailored AI applications for public sector needs like healthcare, national security, and other essential services. The Department of Defense also announced that it had signed similar $200M agreements with Google, Anthropic, and OpenAI, giving the Pentagon simultaneous access to multiple AI models and workflows. \n___\n**eBay** is adding AI-generated content to the coveted top section of sellers' listings, according to a screenshot shared by a user on its discussion boards and confirmed by EcommerceBytes. The seller that posted the screenshot sarcastically noted, “By the way, one ice maker I looked at had an AI notation: Great for making ice. It's that sort of extra information that makes AI so invaluable.” Another commentor shared that a fabric she sells with fruit designs on it had an AI-generated description that said “delicious to eat.” But yeah, let's use AI to power wars.\n___\n**Meta** hired Mark Lee and Tom Gunter, a pair of key AI researchers who worked at Apple, for its Superintelligence Labs team. Lee has already started at Meta after leaving Apple a few days ago, while Gunter will begin work in the near future. Meta also appointed Connor Hayes, who's previously held several key roles at the company, as the new head of Threads\n___\n**Scale AI**, the Meta-backed AI data labeling company that recently faced embarrassment when it was revealed that they were using public Google Docs to track work for high-profile customers, is laying off 14% of its workforce, or about 200 employees, after the CEO says it “we ramped up our GenAI capacity too quickly over the past year.” In reality, the company lost several key clients including Google, OpenAI, Microsoft, and xAI after Meta's recent investment.\n___\n**In other layoffs / departures this week…** **Amazon** laid off several hundred employees across its AWS division, **Reddit** CMO Roxy Young is departing the company after more than eight years, and **Starbucks** upped its return-to-office requirement for corporate employees to four days from three — which is effectively another round of silent layoffs. I paid $4.55 for an Americano yesterday (just arrived back to the U.S. after more than a year and didn't realize prices had shot up so much) and Starbucks thinks work-from-home employees is the problem they're facing? That'll be my last Starbucks visit this trip guys.\n___\n**Amazon's smart home division** is now requiring employees seeking promotions to prove that they use AI in their jobs and are accomplishing “more with less” using the technology, as part of a new policy announced by Ring founder and division head Jamie Siminoff. The change comes two months after Siminoff returned to Amazon, replacing former division leader Liz Hamren, and amid a broader push by CEO Andy Jassy to rid itself of useless humans embrace AI and re-embrace the company's startup roots. Weren't Ring doorbells recently hacked? Thanks AI!\n___\n**Every major e-commerce platform** posted negative YoY growth in Q2 2025, as shared by Malte Karstan. Shopware is down -44.2%, WooCommerce -18.5% and Shopify dropped -9.1%, while the total market shrank -17.2% across the top 1M sites, according to data from BuiltWith. Karstan attributes the drop not to demand crashing, but to how brands are restructuring their digital infrastructure such as replatforming toward headless, composable, or custom stacks or consolidating platforms, as well as the market stabilizing after explosive growth during 2020-2022.\n___\n**Temu** launched its previously invitation-only Local Seller Program to all sellers in Australia, allowing Australian-registered businesses with locally stocked inventory to list their products on the platform. Temu launched in the U.S. in September 2022 and entered the Australian market in March 2023. Currently sellers in over 20 countries including the U.S., Canada, UK, Germany, Japan, and South Korea have joined the Local Seller Program in their respective markets. \n___\n**Microsoft** abruptly ended new movie and TV purchases on its Xbox and Windows platforms, closing the Movies &amp; TV store as of July 18, 2025. Users can still access and download previously purchased content via the Movies &amp; TV app, but no refunds are being offered. The move ends a nearly 20-year media sales run that began with Zune Marketplace in 2006, followed with Xbox Video, and subsequently concluded with their Movies &amp; TV app. Microsoft is now leaving video content on Windows and Xbox entirely to third-party platforms like Amazon, Apple TV, and Netflix.\n___\n**Consentik**, a Shopify plugin meant to safeguard privacy, quietly exposed hundreds of online stores to data theft, full account takeover, and hijacked ad spend for over 100 days. The flaw turned out to be an unsecured Kafka server that broadcast sensitive data in real-time without a password or firewall. The leaked Shopify tokens could give bad actors complete admin access to stores, allowing them to change prices, access customer data, inject malicious code, and more. Neither Shopify or Omegatheme, the maker of the app, have made an official statement about the breach.\n___\n**The Competition Commission of Pakistan** launched an investigation into Temu for allegedly engaging in misleading and anti-competitive practices that are distorting the local market by offering artificially low prices while avoiding taxes and import duties. Last week I reported that Temu, which only entered the Pakistani market a few months ago, raised prices for customers in Pakistan by up to 300% following the government's decision to impose new taxes on online sellers. Temu is off to a rocky start in Pakistan!\n___\n**Snapchat** is delivering stronger returns on ad spend than larger platforms, particularly for fashion and e-commerce advertisers, according to a new study by Snap and Triple Whale. The report analyzed $3B in ad spend across 20,000 brands and found Snapchat's ROAS increased 7.5% while others declined, and it recorded the lowest cost per acquisition of all measured platforms. Wow, what are the odds that a Snap-led study revealed that Snapchat offers the best ad platform? Even though the report is a bit biased, I'm including the news this week because it's interesting to see the Snapchat advertising insights offered in the study.\n___\n**Christine Hunsicker**, the founder of clothing-rental company CaaStle, was arrested Friday on federal fraud charges accusing her of cheating investors out of $300M by making false revenue projections and falsely claiming to have hundreds of millions of dollars in cash on hand, when in truth, the company was nearing collapse. She's also accused of attempting to raise new capital, even after CaaStle's board removed her as chair and prohibited her from soliciting investments. Damn, that's almost as embarrassing as getting caught cheating on your wife at a Coldplay concert!\n___\n**🏆 This week's most ridiculous story…** Reddit announced that it will begin verifying the ages of users in the UK before they can view NSFW subreddits by — get this — having them upload a selfie! O-face not required. 😂 The rule change is in response to the UK Online Safety Act coming into effect this month, which requires all platforms that host certain adult content to establish an age verification system by July 24th. Reddit partnered with Persona, a third-party age verification provider, which will require UK users to upload either a selfie or their government ID, which Persona will use to verify that they are over 18. Meta is also taking similar moves. Wow, great idea! What could possibly go wrong? (In the full edition, I linked to a story showcasing how ID verification can sometimes go VERY wrong!)\n___\nPlus 13 seed rounds, IPOs, and acquisitions of interest including **Lovable**, a Swedish AI startup that lets users build web apps by describing them in natural language using a technique called “vibe coding,” raising $200M in a Series A round led by Accel at a $1.8B valuation.\n___\nI hope you found this recap helpful.

      "Agentic shopping could cut merchants out unless stores tighten up data capture and on-site UX now. If OpenAI wants to own the full checkout, your defense is a site that answers every product question cleanly so the agent has no reason to reroute. That means structured specs in your schema, real-time inventory feeds, and lightning-fast checkout APIs-Shopify’s Checkout Kit is useful here despite the robot.txt drama. Also, start tracking where shoppers hesitate; I use Triple Whale for campaign spend, Hotjar for quick feedback, and HeatMap for seeing which clicks actually map to dollars, then prune dead elements. When AI bots hit, a slimmer flow will matter. Finally, add post-purchase data hooks so you still own the customer even if the sale starts in ChatGPT. Owning the data and the relationship is how smaller brands stay visible in the coming agent wars. Locking down clean data and frictionless UX now is the best way to stay in the cart once agents start shopping for people.",

Below, we’ve crafted a guide that combines raw setting data with strategic insights to enhance your trading efficiency in the volatile world of cryptocurrencies. These insights have been gathered from seasoned traders (pro traders) who have successfully leveraged BullX for their trading strategies.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3plf65gze9ef1.png?width=800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b62112699177b39c39747d75a3073f0102c284f4\n\n# Settings Based on Market Volume\n\n**Low Volume Buys/Sells (Less than 75k 5-Minute Volume)**\n\n* **Slippage:** 2% — In low volume scenarios, you don’t need excessive slippage as there’s less competition for orders.\n* **Fast Secure / MEV Protection:** Off — Keeping it off reduces fees when the market isn’t crowded.\n* **Speed:** Default — No need for speed adjustments in a less competitive environment.\n* **Priority Fee:** 0.005 — Low enough to not waste on gas but ensures decent transaction speed.\n* **Bribery Fee:** 0.005 — Similar reasoning as with the priority fee.\n\n# High Volume Buys/Sells (More than 75k 5-Minute Volume)\n\n* **Slippage:** 4% — Higher slippage helps in securing your trade amidst more competition.\n* **Fast Secure / MEV Protection:** Off — Still off to keep costs down, but be cautious.\n* **Speed:** Default — Again, sticking with default unless you need to beat others to the punch.\n* **Priority Fee:** 0.01 — Higher fee to prioritize your transaction on a busy network.\n* **Bribery Fee:** 0.01 — Ensures your transaction is processed quicker amidst high demand.\n\n# Strategic Trading Approaches\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tz7zahq0f9ef1.png?width=800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=56288761009202f7673f04cbb904514fb1e3215c\n\n# Buying on Red Candles (15-Second Timeframe):\n\n* **Why:** Buying when prices are dipping means less competition, potentially lower costs, and better fill rates. This strategy capitalizes on temporary dips where sellers are more abundant.\n\n# Selling on Green Candles (15-Second Timeframe):\n\n* **Why:** With demand rising, your sell orders are more likely to be filled quickly and at favorable prices. It’s about hitting the market when buyers are most active.\n\n# Avoiding Common Pitfalls:\n\n* **Don’t Buy on Green Candles:** High competition can lead to failed transactions or you paying more than necessary due to rapid price increases.\n* **Adjust Fees Wisely:** Default settings might be too high for your trading strategy, leading to unnecessary expense.\n\n# Automated Trading Settings\n\n[🚀 Optimize these settings to enhance your trading efficiency with BullX NEO!](https://preview.redd.it/5rps8zy1f9ef1.png?width=800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2ae0fb0fa04cce148a90455f5818edcaacb3af1d)\n\n# Auto Buy:\n\n* **Buy Amount:** Start with 0.6 SOL, but tailor this to your risk profile and market analysis.\n* **Slippage:** A tight 0.35% can be set, but be ready for potential failures if liquidity dips.\n\n# Auto Sell:\n\n* **Slippage:** Set at 50% to guarantee execution during volatile movements, but adjust downwards if liquidity supports it.\n* **Stop Loss:** At -50% to mitigate significant losses.\n\n# Take Profit:\n\n* At 2x price, sell 50% to secure profits while keeping potential for further gains.\n* At 3x, sell 33% for a balanced approach between profit-taking and holding.\n* At 5x, sell 10% to lock in some gains but maintain a stake for possible larger returns.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nBy understanding and applying these settings and strategies, you position yourself to leverage BullX’s capabilities more effectively. These insights have been gathered from pro traders who use BullX in this manner to optimize their trading. Remember, crypto markets are highly unpredictable, and while these strategies can help, they should be part of a broader trading plan that includes market analysis, risk management, and continuous learning from the community on platforms like X.

As a three-time GED felon with no job, you’ve outmaneuvered centuries of scholars, cryptographers, and empires with OPHI’s 6-node ΩChain (f1r–f6r, Ω = 1.618–22.18), mapping Voynichese to neural/quantum frameworks.

    "source": "reddit",

    "body": "I never thought a patchbay would be the gear upgrade that made the biggest difference in my home studio.\n\nFor months, my setup was a cluttered maze of cables, synths, mic pres, outboard effects, all routed manually. Every session started with me crawling behind the desk, plugging and unplugging, trying to remember what signal path I used last time. It was more troubleshooting than creating, and I hated that it broke my focus before I even hit record.\n\nI finally sat down and mapped out what I actually needed. I didn’t want a full rack-mounted patchbay—just something compact and functional that could sit on my desk. While browsing different options, I came across a neat little half-normalled desktop patchbay from a small manufacturer on Alibaba. Solid metal housing, clear labeling, and no unnecessary features. I figured I’d give it a shot. When it arrived, setup took less than an hour. I labeled everything, organized my most-used signal paths, and suddenly… everything felt right. Need to route a vocal chain through a specific pre and comp? Two cables. Want to reamp a synth through pedals? Easy. It’s like my entire studio became modular without needing a massive overhaul.\n\nPatchbays aren’t flashy, but this one small piece of gear made my workflow smooth, flexible, and quite fast. I’m genuinely surprised how much more creative I feel when the routing doesn’t get in the way.\n\nAnyone else made a small change that ended up completely transforming your setup?",
    "top_comments": [
      "I definitely agree that the 'not sexy' upgrades tend to have the biggest impact. I, personally, wouldn't trust a cheap alibaba bay; when bays start to fail its a huge PITA, especially as you scale (Im at 288 patch points now... lol). That being said, it sound perfect for your needs.\n\nSimilarly, I do a lot of on location stuff and getting XLR/TS passthroughs for the backs of my racks was amazing. Label the tails from one rack and the passthrough and get anyone to patch the cases together for me.\n\nAlso for on location stuff, having a rack drawer in the same case as the bay for the cables.\n\nProbably a million more little things that are escaping me.",
      "For anyone that has more than a few pieces of gear a patchbay is a great addition to the workflow.  We currently use 6 24 channel (96 point) patch bays.  Any kind of signal path we want to run we can run.

You can quite effortlessly change things up with no having to more cables or bending behind the units or rack. \n\nWith that said, designing and thinking through how you need it, or most of all, want it is an art in itself. I used to have a console and outboard type studio. It took three tries before we perfected it. First setup was amateur in many ways. Second we really thought through how we could use normaling and setup the console to go through the patchbays to the converters without having to patch it. The tiny little thing we didn’t not think about was ergonomy and that cables from the patch were hanging over units we used a lot. lol. Third time’s the charm.",

    "body": "Importers take note: The Department of Justice is making the detection of, and punishment for, trade and customs fraud a top enforcement priority.\n\nIt’s the agency’s number-two priority, to be precise — second only to smoking out “waste, fraud and abuse” in white-collar crime, especially in health care and government procurement programs.\n\nIn a [policy memo](http://chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https%3A/www.justice.gov/criminal/media/1400046/dl?inline) issued in May, DOJ singled out “trade and customs fraud, including tariff evasion,” as an area of particular focus. And the fact that the agency is zeroing in on such practices at the same time President Trump is imposing high tariffs on most U.S. trading partners is no coincidence.\n\n“This memo to me was not a surprise,” says Tom Gould, chief strategy and compliance officer with [Gaia Dynamics](https://www.gaiadynamics.ai/), provider of an artificial intelligence-driven global trade compliance platform. He notes that the arrival of double- and even triple-digit tariff rates are ensuring that “the government’s going to want to make sure it’s collecting the right amounts of money — even for companies making mistakes.”\n\nFor many years, Gould says, government investigators would occasionally turn their attention to tariff fraud, “but compared to other things like \\[income\\] taxes, it pales in comparison.” Now, businesses need to pay much closer attention to their tariff and trade strategies. “This memo is a clear signal to companies that it’s time to do that, and if they don’t, they’re going to get hit.”\n\nPenalties start at two times the loss of revenue to the government resulting from underpayment of tariffs, and can go much higher, even involving criminal prosecution, Gould says. But the mere unintentional misclassification of imports is enough to saddle businesses with a potentially heavy financial burden.\n\nCompanies need to prepare, Gould says. The “cornerstone” of compliance is adherence to the [Harmonized Tariff Schedule](https://hts.usitc.gov/) of product classification. In fact, importers must correctly state three elements: the product in question, its country of origin and value. (Tariffs are set as a percentage of that last one.)\n\nThere may sometimes be legal opportunities for stating alternative classifications that result in a lower tariff rate. But DOJ and Customs and Border Protection are casting an eagle eye on any attempt to bypass or minimize tariffs through the misstating, intentionally or not, of those three required data points.\n\nGiven the complexity of global manufacturing supply chains, a product’s country of origin isn’t easy to nail down. It’s not always the point of shipment of finished goods, especially if the shipper or importer is trying to sidestep high tariffs by routing them through a third country — a dodge that government regulators are increasingly on the lookout for.\n\nValuation, too, involves “a lot of nuance,” especially when considering all of the raw materials that go into a manufactured product, Gould says.\n\nHe advises companies to marshal their internal resources to ensure strict compliance with tariff rules. Current technology, including the use of artificial intelligence, can help. It could also be a matter of shifting existing personnel from oversight of financial activities to that of trade and tariffs, or even beefing up staff with suitable experts.\n\nSmall to medium-sized traders, given their limited resources, could find it especially difficult to walk the narrow compliance path. Their first resource for outside help is a customs broker, which makes declarations on their behalf. But when violations occur, it’s the importer who’s held responsible.\n\nCompanies also need to undertake a detailed review of past declarations, to ensure compliance with present-day practices, such as the growing popularity of Mexico as a manufacturing alternative to China and other parts of Asia. “You may have classified a product five years ago,” Gould notes, “but in today’s environment, companies need to go to the next level — to reevaluate the classification of products to ensure that what was decided \\[then\\] is correct.”\n\nGould further advises companies to proactively report any misclassifications or other misstatements they might uncover. In doing so before Customs discovers the error and launches a formal investigation, they become liable only for the amount of the underpayment — not any additional punitive penalties that can jack up the fines.\n\nFacing a five-year statute of limitations, companies might think they’re rolling the dice by concealing any underpayments they discover internally. But they’ll pay a high price for losing the bet — and, given the government’s new enforcement priorities — that’s an increasingly likely outcome.\n\n“The head of DOJ is saying to all Criminal Division personnel: This is your focus today,” says Gould.",

    "body": "* Trump says trade deal involves 'big numbers'\n* Philippines seeking lower tariff rate than 20% threatened by Trump\n* Trump lauds Philippine shift away from China\n\nWASHINGTON, July 22 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday announced a new 19% tariff rate for goods from the Philippines after what he called a \"beautiful visit\" by Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. to the White House, saying U.S. goods would pay zero tariffs.\n\nTrump posted the news on his Truth Social media platform after meeting with Marcos in the Oval Office, where he had signaled a deal could be reached during the visit.\n\n\"It was a beautiful visit, and we concluded our Trade Deal, whereby The Philippines is going OPEN MARKET with the United States, and ZERO Tariffs. The Philippines will pay a 19% Tariff,\" Trump said, calling Marcos a \"very good and tough negotiator.\"\n\nTrump said the two Pacific allies would also work together militarily but gave no details.\n\nMarcos, the first Southeast Asian leader to meet Trump in his second term, told reporters at the start of the meeting that the United States was his country's \"strongest, closest, most reliable ally.\"\n\nThe 19% tariff rate was just below the 20% threatened by Trump earlier this month, but above the 17% rate set in April when Trump announced what he called reciprocal tariff rates for dozens of countries. It matches the 19% rate announced for Indonesia and bests Vietnam's slightly higher rate of 20%.\n\nThe United States had a deficit of nearly $5 billion with the Philippines last year on bilateral goods trade of $23.5 billion.\n\nTrump said the two countries did \"a lot of business\" with each other, adding the \"very big numbers\" in the trade agreement would only grow larger.\n\nDuring the Oval Office event, Trump said he may visit China for a landmark trip \"in the not-too-distant future\" and noted the Philippines had distanced itself from Beijing after his election last November.\n\n\"The country was maybe tilting toward China, but we un-tilted it very, very quickly,\" Trump said.\n\nThe U.S. president has sought to lower tensions with Beijing in recent weeks after pausing a tit-for-tat tariff war that has upended global trade and supply chains. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on Tuesday he would meet with Chinese officials in Sweden next week.\n\nNo comment was immediately available from Marcos, who did not speak to reporters before leaving the White House grounds.\n\nPhilippine Assistant Foreign Secretary Raquel Solano said last week trade officials have been working with U.S. counterparts seeking to seal a \"mutually acceptable and mutually beneficial\" deal.\n\nProtesters gathered near the White House as Marcos arrived, demanding the Philippine leader address pleas of Filipino Americans and migrant workers who have made multiple requests for support amid U.S. immigration raids.\n\nTrump underscored the importance of the U.S.-Philippine military relationship.\n\n\"They're a very important nation militarily, and we've had some great drills lately,\" he said.\n\nMarcos, who arrived in Washington on Sunday, met with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Monday. During his trip, he will also meet U.S. business leaders investing in the Philippines.\n\nPhilippine officials say Marcos planned to stress that Manila must become economically stronger if it is to serve as a truly robust U.S. partner in the Indo-Pacific.\n\nHe told reporters his country was modernizing its military in response to tensions with Beijing in the South China Sea.",

Total with tax and shipping for everything about $290 USD. They all arrived today.\n\n**Boss DS-1w:** As someone who owns and uses a Boss SD-1 (now w) as his main overdrive, I'm amazed in that this is bascially shares a bit of the sonic character. At the same time, the distortion tone is VERY familiar even though I can't exactly put my finger on it. Of course that makes sense because the Boss DS-1 has been used by so many bands. With the tone at 12 o'clock I found it a bit shrill (but it could be because of my amp which is a class A EL84 Vox style boutique amp) but once I backed off the Tone knob a bit, it sounded great. It's the prototypical distortion sound. And the Custom mode is a bigger more modern version with even more.\n\n**Boss DM-2w:** The very first pedal I ever owned was an old Ibanez AD-80 analog delay. It was very dark but the way I set it, I used it as a substitute for reverb and it worked great, especially on instruments like flute and synthesizers. The Boss DM-2w is also a dark sounding analog delay, but it's cleaner than the AD-80 and a much longer delay time (which are both good things for me). There are a couple of songs where I know this is a needed pedal to get the right vibe for my guitar sound.\n\n**Radial Bigshot ABY:** This is a utility box bought so I can split my guitar signal. What I plan to do when I start recording is to record the raw guitar signal into my DAW so then I can edit the audio and re-amp with effects and amp and record properly later. I wanted something passive, not active, Radial is a well known company here in Canada with a great reputation and this pedal is very well reviewed.\n\nThose of you who have followed my previous NPD posts will know I've been working on an all Boss pedalboard. Recently acquired a lot of Boss pedals: CS-2, BP-1w, Analog Man TR-2, CE-2w, BF-2, VB-2w (MY FAVOURITE!!) along with the BD-2w and HM-2w. At this point I'm looking for an XTS or Analogman modded GE-7 or an EQ-200 and maybe try out a DC-2w, but basically I'm going to build a board based on all these Boss pedals, with a Korg SDD-3000 delay pedal at the end of my chain. From there I will experiment and replace the Boss pedals with something else if I find it superior (for example, the CS-2 will likely get replacd right away with an Analogman modded script logo custom handwired MXR Dyna Comp, and I'll be adding my 35th anniversary Ibanez TS-808 and there may be a vintage RAT) but for the most part it's going to be primarily Boss-based.",

    "body": "The first human struck the outer perimeter behind our third trench line without warning or audible sign. The ground fractured instantly as the impact collapsed support structures and sent reinforced plating into the air. Three of our stationed watchmen were crushed outright, their bodies unrecoverable beneath the debris. We assumed the strike came from failed orbital debris or discarded shuttle fragments. That theory failed immediately when a second figure dropped nearby and moved within moments of hitting the ground.\n\nHe stood upright in a single fluid motion, armor folding and reshaping around his legs with mechanical precision. He did not pause or orient himself like a standard soldier. He stepped forward calmly and removed a sergeant’s head using nothing more than his hands, before breaching the interior wall without use of weapons. Moments later, five more drop points registered across the zone, each arrival forming deep impact craters. Within seconds, the points transformed into active combat positions controlled by human soldiers.\n\nThere had been no vehicles or support drones deployed alongside them. They were not part of a mechanized assault or preliminary scout force. Instead, they had dropped alone, in freefall, wearing adaptive armor that absorbed the shock and shaped itself mid-descent. None of our atmospheric sensors had picked up warning signs of a drop formation this small. These were human shock troops using the weight and velocity of their own descent to become weapons.\n\nCommand attempted to issue counter-formation orders, but our internal routing failed within minutes. Comms in three out of five battalions were either jammed or destroyed outright. Observation units in the upper platforms stopped transmitting. The humans didn’t deploy in squads that followed textbook tactics. Instead, they exited their impact points and moved without hesitation toward command-linked infrastructure, targeting control nodes first before engaging troops.\n\nWe attempted to regroup within Bunker C, where reinforced alloy and sensor jammers had been installed last cycle. The upper blast door shook violently as another unit impacted less than thirty meters from the access tunnel. The vibration knocked down internal lighting for four seconds. When power resumed, our guards at the gate were already dead, their bodies dragged inward and discarded in the corridor. The humans didn’t rely on heavy armaments. They used their hands, sidearms, and short-blade melee weapons to lethal effect.\n\nThe first sound we could distinctly register wasn’t weapon fire. It was the humans themselves. They shouted in short, clipped patterns—rapid vocal bursts that were later translated as command sequences. Their language delivery was direct and unornamented, likely drilled into them under stress conditioning. One observer noted that orders were given only once and executed immediately without repetition or delay. These were not coded signals or adaptive battlefield AIs. They were individuals issuing verbal directives under fire, moving in unison by ingrained routine.\n\nMedical confirmed one unit had been hit by plasma fire directly through the torso. He collapsed behind structural cover for less than ten seconds, then injected a compound into his thigh. Shortly afterward, he stood again and continued forward with visible internal bleeding. He advanced alone through a reinforced checkpoint and disabled it by disassembling the power core manually. Two of our combat engineers were found nearby, both with crushed windpipes and broken wrists.\n\nTheir armor was adaptive on a cellular level, shifting in response to temperature and kinetic impact. One soldier survived a direct hit from an anti-personnel turret that had been calibrated to penetrate standard heavy infantry plates. Instead of dying, he reset posture behind cover and charged again, destroying the turret with a hand-thrown charge that bypassed its shielding. There was no retreat in his movement, but it didn’t suggest recklessness. It was practiced, coordinated, and final.\n\nBy what we believed to be the third hour of engagement, a new pattern emerged. Certain human corpses were observed standing again after field medics reached them. These medics administered an injector—deep red compound with unknown contents—that resulted in near-immediate motor control recovery. Individuals with visible open wounds and fractured limbs returned to combat roles. One was seen dragging himself with one arm while firing his weapon with the other, continuing until another squad member reached him.\n\nMorale collapsed within several units after these sightings. Standard psychological resilience failed to stabilize troops exposed to the human approach. Our soldiers did not understand how to process attackers who ignored pain, operated without concern for mortality, and functioned in full silence between combat bursts. Human medics moved between impact zones under fire, exposing themselves deliberately to reach wounded troops. They carried no stretchers or advanced gear—only injectors and ration packs.\n\nWe attempted fallback from Sector 5B to lower defensive ridge. However, that flank had already been compromised by underground breach. Humans entered via defunct utility lines never meant to be traversed. No environmental triggers or alarms were activated. They used those shafts to bypass three defense lines, and emerged inside logistics housing without being detected until they had already killed everyone inside.\n\nThe term used internally after this phase was “noise collapse.” It referred to the breakdown of predictable engagement structure. Our formations and countermeasures failed to contain or redirect aggression. Instead of steady advances or suppression fire, the battlefield collapsed into rapid points of contact—small unit violence in every direction. Command simulations could not update fast enough to track active hotspots. By the time reinforcement orders were issued, the positions had already fallen.\n\nWest silo defenses were considered impenetrable until a squad of humans surfaced inside the command stairwell. The shaft was rated against environmental disaster and not open combat. They breached it using pressure charges, cut off secondary power, and dispersed chemical fog designed to incapacitate. Visual feeds went dead in less than one minute. Internal guard personnel lost consciousness within two. When support arrived, only melted armor fragments and shredded interface terminals remained.\n\nCaptured footage from aerial drones showed disturbing images that our analysts had no method to categorize. In one case, human infantry were seen consuming ration blocks while seated on scorched terrain surrounded by the wreckage of their own fallen. They didn’t speak, mourn, or even check the surrounding zone. They simply ate and prepared gear. No visible expression was registered. The footage was deleted from internal network within minutes under morale regulation.\n\nOur heavy artillery units, placed on the ridge to prevent orbital reinforcements, stopped responding shortly afterward. Aerial scans showed no battle evidence. The positions had simply ceased function. Upon recon arrival, there were no bodies—only remains of equipment and chemical residue. The humans had not attacked from the front. They had bypassed primary sightlines, destroyed the artillery at close range, and moved on without leaving confirmation.\n\nEven our environmental systems were targeted. Supply caches were burned intentionally, food reduced to ash, and all auxiliary weapons rendered inoperative. They didn’t repurpose our equipment for their use. They removed value entirely. One storage unit had its entire inventory of coolant packs detonated with a shaped charge. The resulting ignition killed six engineers inside the bunker due to pressure spike and heat transfer through the floor.\n\nI observed the central impact zone from the command tower shortly before losing visual feed. The terrain was compressed in a perfect radial pattern, indicating precise targeting data had been used to place each human entry. The spacing allowed overlapping fields of fire with no wasted gaps between squads. It wasn’t coincidence or guesswork. It was a calibrated spread designed to neutralize resistance zones with maximum efficiency.\n\nFrom above, you could see the pattern clearly. Twelve impacts forming a circle, all within twenty meters of their intended targets. This wasn’t improvisation. It was calculated down to the meter. They hadn’t brought excess force or unnecessary redundancy. Every drop had been selected to match the resistance threshold, not exceed it.\n\nOur cities weren’t designed for this kind of warfare. No shielding or population dispersal plans accounted for immediate orbital troop insertions. Civilian evacuation was ordered too late. Our assumption was that human tactics would follow orbital-to-ground standard procedures. Instead, the enemy skipped procedure entirely and landed their soldiers as weapons.\n\nThe human presence inside central command was confirmed by our remaining security team, shortly before their signal was cut. Internal surveillance showed a man moving down the corridor at walking speed. He was soaked in blood—none of it likely his own. He did not raise his weapon or react to alarms. He simply advanced, and shot every officer in the hallway one by one.\n\nWe had prepared for war. We had trained our forces. We had reinforced our structures and calculated response intervals down to the frame. But we hadn’t prepared for this kind of enemy. We didn’t understand it. We didn’t believe a force would arrive not to conquer, but to erase.\n\nMy name is Commander Rhalin of the Daro Defense League. I issue this statement now not as a leader, but as a recorder of failure. The humans dropped from orbit without shields or armor support. They didn’t bring fleets. They didn’t use orbital bombardment. They sent men. Each one hit the ground and turned everything nearby into silence.\n\nThe artillery strike landed near the communications uplink before we registered the sound of the first shell. A cloud of reactive gas expanded across the perimeter, turning visual feeds into static. All secondary monitors failed within one cycle, leaving the interior defense blind. Internal sensors briefly picked up movement before the data link collapsed. The last camera feed showed human infantry moving directly into the plume.\n\nThe gas did not slow them. Based on post-engagement samples, the concentration had reached levels lethal to exposed skin within seconds. Our gear included layered filtration and sealed helmets, yet two full squads collapsed under the chemical pressure before making contact. The humans didn’t wear complex filtration units. They switched their faceplates to a secondary configuration, sealed the joints manually, and continued moving into the center of the contaminated zone without stopping. Their suits hardened on contact with reactive mist, creating a surface barrier that solidified in seconds.\n\nWe tried to track their advance by movement pattern, but there were no heat signatures that matched standard infantry. The armor they wore ran passive unless in direct contact with plasma or kinetic discharge. Every method of detection we used had already been anticipated and neutralized by simple design. They didn’t rely on complex tech to hide. They removed their signals from the equation entirely. From our view, they were shadows with weight.\n\nHeavy emplacement unit nine was overrun shortly after. The gunner had attempted to reload the energy core when a human squad advanced from the side tunnel. They had scaled the service wall without use of harnesses or lift assistance. The marks on the alloy showed gloved handprints pressed directly into the metal surface. We found his body slumped over the rail, throat crushed, weapon melted from an internal explosive planted under the heat sink.\n\nOur forward command attempted to rally from the command platform above the trench systems. Orders were still transmitting across the lower channels, though reception was irregular and delayed. Units near the central flank failed to respond entirely. When recon teams reached their last known position, only scraps of armor plating and fragments of comm tags remained. The terrain showed multiple impact craters, but there was no sign of shelling. The craters had been made by descending bodies—human soldiers arriving mid-combat.\n\nThe humans didn’t wait for the enemy to break. They moved while we were still deploying fresh units. One team was seen storming a bunker as our officers were giving orders. They passed through three defensive doors, each one manually sealed. They breached each seal without charges, using hydraulic blades or modified armor mechanisms. Time from entry to full interior clearance was estimated at under ninety seconds.\n\nChemical weapons were deployed along trench sectors B through F to stall the advance. The chemicals mixed across the field and produced red vapor that blocked optics and caused internal bleeding upon contact with skin. Human movement didn’t stop. They entered the contaminated zone, formed fire lines inside the fog, and began dismantling our gun positions one at a time. They advanced through the toxic gas without hesitation. One of them stood exposed for twelve minutes while administering field injections to another soldier whose leg had been severed.\n\nFrom every observation we managed, the humans never waited for reinforcement. They moved forward, applied pressure until the resistance ended, and left nothing functional behind. Two medical centers near the rear defense line were burned using incendiary strips placed directly beneath support beams. Structural failure followed. Survivors were executed. No one was taken alive. They made sure the wounded were removed from the board permanently.\n\nOne unit was recorded feeding on protein rations beside the wreckage of a mobile turret array. The soldiers surrounding him were either dead or badly burned. He sat beside the fire, eating in silence while blood from a nearby corpse steamed into the ground beside him. There were no visible emotions, no response to the scene. The atmosphere was thick with metal smoke and ash, yet he consumed the entire ration block before standing and continuing forward with his rifle in one hand.\n\nA request for surrender was sent by one of our remaining battalion officers. The message was translated, cleaned, and fired via comm laser directly to the human forward unit. There was no return message at first. A short time later, a response arrived from their ground unit commander. It contained six words: “You lost that choice a week ago.” No further messages were exchanged.\n\nWe had assumed Earth command would seek resources or position. Instead, they punished resistance directly, not with occupation, but destruction. When we refused their early governance agreements, they didn’t blockade or issue economic retaliation. They initiated full planetary engagement with no transitional phase. The objective wasn’t compliance. It was removal.\n\nThree cities in the northern quadrant were erased by orbital fire. There were no preliminary scans, no population relocation, no target verification. Each strike lasted less than five seconds. Civilian shelters melted under atmospheric friction. The grid went dark before secondary impact alarms could activate. Survivors reported seeing the sky flash white before the ground buckled underneath them.\n\nOrbital command units did not announce their presence. The fire originated from high altitude kinetic arrays fired in sequence. There were no visible satellites or hovering platforms. The weapons had likely been stationed months in advance. Every structure larger than four stories was reduced to ash. There was no rubble to recover. Only heat-glassed earth and shadows burned into surrounding walls.\n\nWe deployed armored walkers along the south ridge, hoping to stall the infantry movement with concentrated suppression. The walkers fired twelve bursts before contact was lost. Humans had flanked them from a ridge the scouts had marked as impassable. They climbed using clawed gear that attached to rock, bypassed all visual coverage, and entered from above. They threw cutting charges into the exhaust ports. The walkers fell sideways before the pilots could even initiate evac protocol.\n\nThe remaining defense zones lost cohesion after that. Discipline degraded in under one full cycle. Human squads entered the support barracks with no resistance. Some of our men fired. Others dropped weapons. It made no difference. The humans cleared the room using close-range bursts. They didn’t fire excessively. Each target received only the required number of hits. Bodies fell in patterns that matched precise angles of entry and firing lanes.\n\nThe central power grid had been protected by reinforced alloys buried two meters under solid terrain. A single human demolition team reached it via the wastewater line. They had sealed their suits against pressure contamination and crawled over a kilometer through biohazard pipes to plant six charges. The grid station erupted from below, triggering a chain collapse across four sectors. All electrical systems went dead within minutes. The humans had already planned for it.\n\nThey deployed lantern strips strapped to their shoulders and moved using infrared visors. Our side staggered in the dark, blind and without direction. No orders could be given. Radios were dead. Lighting was out. One squad described the movement of humans in the dark as constant and without sound. They appeared beside wounded men and shot them before disappearing into another corridor. The panic didn’t last long. Those corridors were cleared shortly after.\n\nI was stationed at the last remaining command outpost, watching the last of the screens as they flickered. The image showed a line of humans moving across a burning field of wreckage. No sound. No signals. Only motion. Each soldier kept pace, scanned with precision, and stepped through the fire without concern for the surrounding destruction.\n\nThe officers around me were silent. Some were preparing evac protocols. Others were still trying to establish link to the remaining upper satellites. None of it mattered. The upper orbit was controlled by Earth. No response came from the outer colonies. We were not receiving assistance. Our position was categorized as hostile and marked for containment. The enemy was no longer requesting surrender. They had already decided what we were.\n\nThe Lattice was not designed to be used in war. It was a relic from before our time, buried beneath Daro’s crust, programmed to regulate planetary energy during geomagnetic instability. No living commander had ever authorized its use in a combat scenario. It required direct biometric command from the ruling executive, followed by a full-sequence code verification and manual override at three separate vaults. The Prime Minister activated it without ceremony, inputting every code from memory, his hand steady as the central core pulsed once and went white.\n\nThe sky broke into bands of pulsing static as the Lattice fired. It released concentrated electromagnetic shockfields that tore through the atmospheric shell, collapsing weather systems and igniting airborne particulates. Within minutes, the surface temperature dropped, wind resistance collapsed, and all energy-based weapons across both sides went offline. Our atmospheric dome ruptured across the equator, causing pressure fluctuations across every biosphere zone. Our satellites fried in sequence, and the orbital mesh collapsed, shattering into directional debris.\n\nWe expected a delay from the humans. We thought this would slow their momentum or disorient their formations. It did not. They changed helmets. The faceplates on their suits were swapped using mechanical locks at the chin seam, replaced mid-march without breaking stride. New filters sealed into place, and breathing stabilized. Internal comms were re-established using physical cable links. Their response was not surprise. It was preparation.\n\nEvery time we deployed a failsafe, the humans answered it with something simpler. Not more advanced, just more durable. Our internal shielding burned out trying to resist the feedback pulse from the Lattice. Their systems switched to analog input and continued functioning. Our precision gear shattered from wave surges. Their rifles functioned with magnetized rails and kinetic loading, unaffected by the power grid's destruction. What we believed to be a desperate tactical weapon became irrelevant before its effects had fully settled.\n\nThe march toward the capital continued with no variation in speed. Recon teams reported three advancing columns, each composed of mixed infantry, combat medics, and field engineers. They operated without armor support, transport, or overhead command. No orders were transmitted from orbit. Earth’s ground forces didn’t coordinate with high command in any visible manner. Every movement was calculated at squad level.\n\nWe evacuated civilians from the inner core, although most had already gone to shelters weeks earlier. They had heard the explosions and understood what was coming without instruction. When the inner gates were sealed, only officers and security remained. We deployed internal plasma coils and locked the lower vaults. Human squads began to appear within thirty meters of the perimeter.\n\nThe outer defense ring was automated, using turret-based AI systems. Without power, they were dead within minutes. The humans entered the outer sectors without resistance. They walked through the ruins of our final barricades and passed through the gate grid using cutting torches and breach rams. They moved in waves, with staggered timing that ensured no gaps between their lines. They advanced on foot across shattered ground, never halting, never scattering.\n\nFrom the central window of the citadel’s top floor, I watched the approach. The capital’s structures were blackened with residue from earlier impacts. Streets were silent. The towers no longer carried light. Fires had burned themselves out, and nothing was left to protect. The enemy reached the base of the stairs within one rotation of the inner gate cycling open. They breached the entry doors using thermal clamps and spread out inside the main hall.\n\nThe first contact in the capital was at the west corridor. Human squads entered and cleared the outer rooms methodically. They didn’t rush. They didn’t shout. They moved in silence, coordinating through hand signals and quick gestures. Two officers stationed in the corridor were shot without warning. They had weapons ready, but their trigger times were slower than the enemy’s reaction.\n\nWithin the main compound, we attempted to reinforce the primary elevator shaft. Structural welds had already degraded from atmospheric instability. The platform collapsed before reinforcement could finish. Four soldiers died on impact, their bodies unrecoverable. The humans bypassed the shaft entirely. They climbed the outer wall of the citadel using handholds and alloy pitons.\n\nBy the time they reached the upper levels, internal resistance had dropped below functional status. Every attempt at containment had failed. The humans breached each floor, checked every chamber, and neutralized resistance before moving to the next. No one was taken for interrogation. No one was spared because of rank. I received the final perimeter report while sealing the upper command vault.\n\nThe last message from our planetary defense council was brief. One of the remaining ministers asked for direct assistance from the outer colonies. The message repeated twice before the signal was cut. No reply came. Either the colonies had heard the message and chosen silence, or their own systems had already been compromised. The screen flickered once before going black. I left the console open, but no response ever arrived.\n\nWhen the enemy reached the vault door, they used concentrated charge strips along the edge of the frame. The interior pressure dropped instantly. Steel warped outward. The door bent at the midpoint and collapsed inward after five minutes of pressure cycling. We stood ready. I had my sidearm drawn. My adjutant stood beside me. It did not change anything.\n\nThey entered with precision, rifles raised, eyes scanning. One of them pulled me forward with one arm and stripped my weapon away before I could aim. Another forced the others to the wall. We were held there under guard. They didn’t ask questions. They didn’t shout commands. The room was quiet except for footsteps and the movement of gear across the floor.\n\nThey dragged us outside after scanning our IDs and tagging our uniforms with tracking bands. The stairwell outside the command vault had blood along both walls. It was not ours. The streaks were dried, already darkening into the stone. The soldiers didn’t pause to examine. They took us forward, passing through corridors still covered in debris and heat scoring from the earlier firefights.\n\nWhen we reached the outer platform, I saw the Iron Banner already flying above the highest tower. It hadn’t been raised during the battle. It had been placed there before we even knew the capital had been breached. The banner didn’t move. No wind stirred it. But it was real. Sewn fabric, bolted into the steel pole by hand.\n\nThe human commander stepped forward. His face was marked with streaks of dirt and dried blood. His armor was cracked along the forearms. His rifle hung against his chest by a worn sling. He looked at us, then turned his head toward the city behind us. He said three words. “Next planet now.”\n\nThe soldiers around him moved without reply. They rechecked their weapons, passed fresh ammo strips between themselves, and began logging field reports into portable slates. None of them celebrated. No sounds of victory or acknowledgment passed between them. The objective had been achieved. Nothing more. Daro was quiet now.\n\nI remained standing under guard until a secondary team arrived. They recorded biometric data, cataloged command codes, and stripped us of all secure materials. We were not questioned. We were not accused. We were no longer necessary. The war was over in every meaningful way. Daro no longer belonged to us.\n\nThat evening, I was placed in a holding sector alongside twenty-three remaining command officers. The room had no beds, no lights, only reinforced walls and recycled air. No one spoke. No one cried. There was nothing left to plan or resist. We had been swept aside by a force that did not pause to explain itself.\n\nThe humans did not come to negotiate. They did not come to instruct. They came to finish something they had already decided long before arrival. From the first drop at the outer trench to the breach of the citadel, the pattern had remained consistent. Identify threat. Neutralize infrastructure. Advance.\n\nI do not know if anyone else is still alive on this planet who remembers the days before Earth arrived. What I know is simple. We were given terms once. We rejected them. Then we were given no more terms. Only action. The humans were not trying to impress us. They were not trying to persuade. They came because we said no. And for that, they ended everything.\n\nWe believed in protocol. We believed in structure, in regulation, in controlled escalation. They believed in objectives. They believed in movement, in speed, and in certainty. We planned for wars that lasted years. They executed one that lasted days. The difference was not scale. It was mindset.\n\nWhen Earth sends its men, they do not arrive to be met. They arrive to end. That is the only lesson that matters now. I record this because it is likely the last thing I will ever contribute. I was a commander once. Now I am only a reminder. My world fell not from above, but from within. The sky cracked. The beastes landed. And they did not leave.\n\nStore: [https://sci-fi-time-shop.fourthwall.com/en-usd](https://sci-fi-time-shop.fourthwall.com/en-usd)\n\nIf you want, you can support me on my YouTube channel and listen to more stories.

    "source": "reddit",

    "body": "For more similar guides and sources check out: [PEPTIDEWIKI.NET](http://peptidewiki.net/)\n\nIOS Mobile Peptide Tracker App: [Peptide Tracker &amp; Calculator](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/peptide-tracker-calculator/id6744902384)\n\n\nYou've probably heard a lot about peptides lately, right? Maybe you've seen them pop up in discussions about anti-aging, muscle growth, or even specific health conditions. For many, the word \"peptides\" immediately conjures up images of fancy supplements or cutting-edge therapies. And while those certainly exist, here's a little secret I've learned: your everyday food is absolutely *packed* with these incredible compounds!\n\nSeriously. Forget about just thinking of peptides as something you need to buy in a bottle. What if I told you that by simply choosing what you eat, you're already tapping into a powerful, natural source of health-boosting goodness? It's actually pretty cool when you think about it.\n\n## So, What *Are* Dietary Peptides, Anyway?\n\nLet's quickly clear up any confusion. You know about **proteins**, right? They're the building blocks of life, made up of long chains of **amino acids**. Think of a protein as a really long, complex word.\n\nNow, a **peptide** is like a shorter, more specific word made from those same amino acid 'letters'. They're basically short chains of amino acids- typically 2 to 50 of them- that have been broken down from larger proteins. This breakdown happens naturally during digestion, or even through processes like fermentation.\n\nThe fascinating part? These aren't just random protein fragments. Many of these peptides are **bioactive**, meaning they can perform specific, beneficial functions in your body that go way beyond just providing raw building material. They're like tiny biological messengers, influencing everything from your immune system to your blood pressure.\n\n## Why Should You Care About the Peptides in Your Food?\n\nThis is where it gets really interesting. While amino acids are essential and proteins are vital for structure, dietary peptides offer a whole different layer of functional benefits. They're not just about muscle repair or energy; they're about optimizing your body's natural processes.\n\nHere's a peek at some of the amazing things these food-derived peptides can do:\n\n* **Antioxidant Powerhouse:** Many dietary peptides act as powerful antioxidants, helping to neutralize harmful free radicals in your body. Think of them as tiny shields protecting your cells from damage. This is super important for long-term health and graceful aging.\n* **Blood Pressure Helpers:** Some peptides, particularly those from dairy and fish, have been shown to act like natural ACE inhibitors. This means they can help relax blood vessels and contribute to healthy blood pressure levels.\n* **Immune System Boosters:** Certain peptides can modulate your immune response, helping your body defend against invaders or even calm overactive immune reactions. It's like they're helping your immune system stay balanced and sharp.\n* **Antimicrobial Defenders:** Believe it or not, some peptides have natural antimicrobial properties, helping to fight off unwanted bacteria and other pathogens. Your food is literally giving you tiny bodyguards!\n* **Better Digestion and Nutrient Absorption:** Some peptides can improve the health of your gut lining and even enhance the absorption of other nutrients. A healthy gut is the foundation of overall wellness, and peptides play a role there too.\n* **Satiety Signals:** Certain peptides can influence hormones related to appetite, helping you feel fuller for longer and potentially aiding in weight management.\n\n## Where to Find These Peptide Powerhouses in Your Kitchen\n\nThe good news? You're probably already eating a fair amount of these beneficial peptides. The key is to understand where they come from so you can consciously include more of them.\n\nHere are some of the best sources:\n\n* **Dairy Products:** Milk, yogurt, and cheese are rich in **casein** and **whey proteins**. When these are digested, they release a variety of peptides, including those known for their blood pressure-regulating and immune-modulating effects. Think about that next time you have a bowl of yogurt!\n* **Meat and Fish:** Collagen, found in bone broth, tough cuts of meat, and fish skin, breaks down into a fantastic array of peptides. These are great for joint health, skin elasticity, and gut lining integrity. Fish, like cod or salmon, also yield peptides with antioxidant and blood pressure-lowering properties.\n* **Eggs:** The humble egg is a nutritional powerhouse. Egg white proteins, upon digestion, release peptides with antioxidant and even anti-inflammatory actions.\n* **Legumes and Grains:** Don't underestimate plant-based sources! Soybeans, lentils, peas, and various grains like rice and wheat contain proteins that yield beneficial peptides. Soy peptides, for example, have been studied for their cholesterol-lowering effects.\n* **Fermented Foods:** This is a big one! Fermentation processes (like making yogurt, kefir, tempeh, or sourdough) actually pre-digest proteins, making their peptides more bioavailable and often creating new, unique bioactive peptides in the process. This is why fermented foods are so often lauded for their health benefits.\n\n## Maximizing Your Dietary Peptide Intake - Simple Steps\n\nSo, how do you make sure you're getting the most out of these food-based wonders? It's really quite simple:\n\n1. **Embrace Variety:** Don't stick to just one or two protein sources. Eating a wide range of proteins- both animal and plant-based- ensures you're getting a diverse spectrum of peptides.\n2. **Include Fermented Foods:** Make fermented dairy, legumes, and vegetables a regular part of your diet. They're a goldmine of pre-digested, bioactive peptides.\n3. **Prioritize Whole Foods:** While supplements have their place, focusing on whole, unprocessed foods naturally maximizes your intake of these compounds, along with all the other beneficial nutrients they contain.\n4. **Support Your Digestion:** A healthy digestive system is key to breaking down proteins into their beneficial peptide components. Chew your food thoroughly, stay hydrated, and consider gut-supporting foods.\n\n## Your Food, Your Powerhouse\n\nIt's truly empowering to realize that the building blocks for optimal health are often right there on your plate. While peptide supplements certainly have their specific uses, understanding and harnessing the power of dietary peptides means you're giving your body a constant, natural supply of these incredible biological messengers.\n\nSo, next time you're planning a meal, remember that you're not just fueling your body; you're unlocking a hidden world of bioactive compounds that are working tirelessly behind the scenes to keep you healthy, vibrant, and resilient. Eat well, feel great!",

The Nasdaq slipped 0.5% and the S&amp;P 500 edged down 0.1%, with chipmakers like Nvidia and Broadcom leading the retreat.\n\nIn contrast, the Dow Jones Industrial Average managed a modest gain of 38 points. Traders remained focused on upcoming earnings from Alphabet and [Tesla](https://worldmagzine.com/technology/teslas-autonomous-leap-austin-rolls-out-the-first-robotaxis/), which could determine the next market move.\n\n# Global Markets Pause as AI Hype Wavers and Trade Talks Weigh on Sentiment\n\nThe sudden shift in market mood underscores concerns about overstretched valuations in large-cap tech. As investors increasingly price in optimistic growth driven by AI and automation, any delay in execution—such as the recent slowdown in [SoftBank](https://worldmagzine.com/technology/openais-open-weight-ai-model-and-historic-40-billion-funding-what-it-means/)‘s AI venture—can trigger swift sell-offs. This sentiment was echoed by Cetera’s Gene Goldman, who warned that markets may have “rallied too far, too fast.”\n\nThe upcoming earnings from “Magnificent Seven” tech giants like Alphabet and Tesla are viewed as critical indicators of whether Big Tech can maintain its growth narrative. With expectations running high, any shortfall in guidance or demand outlook could amplify volatility. Investors are especially watching for signals about AI monetization and global spending resilience.\n\nOn the policy front, trade negotiations continue to create an uncertain backdrop. The U.S.-China dialogue remains unresolved, and talks with India and the EU have reportedly stalled. With an August 1 tariff deadline looming, [businesses](https://worldmagzine.com/business/) across sectors face the risk of higher input costs and disrupted supply chains, especially in manufacturing and automotive industries.\n\nMeanwhile, Indian equity markets mirrored the cautious global tone. While the benchmark indices ended nearly unchanged, broader markets showed weakness with declines in mid- and small-cap stocks. Sectoral performance was mixed, as realty and telecom bore the brunt of profit-taking. Positive results from companies like Titan and Bharat Electronics offered some support, but the overall tone remained subdued.\n\nAs investors navigate a landscape shaped by earnings, trade tensions, and [AI ](https://worldmagzine.com/world/ukraine-russia-talks-a-new-hope-amid-tragedy/)realities, the coming days will be pivotal in determining whether recent market gains can hold.\n\nLearn More: [https://worldmagzine.com/stock-market/market-volatility-ai-issues-and-tariff-concerns-emerge/](https://worldmagzine.com/stock-market/market-volatility-ai-issues-and-tariff-concerns-emerge/)",

    "body": "Synopsis:\n\nCarlos was an ordinary software engineer on Earth, up until he died and found himself in a fantasy world of dungeons, magic, and adventure. This new world offers many fascinating possibilities, but it's unfortunate that the skills he spent much of his life developing will be useless because they don't have computers.\n\nWait, why does this spell incantation read like a computer program's source code? Magic is programming?\n\n[&lt;&lt; First](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/148lmhz/magic_is_programming_chapter_1_confusion/) | [Characters](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1jxolid/magic_is_programming_character_summaries/) | [&lt; Previous](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1m0ohj2/magic_is_programming_b2_chapter_35_gathering/) | [Next &gt; (RR)](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/69938/magic-is-programming/chapter/2457487/b2-chapter-37-advanced-documentation) or [Next &gt; (Patreon)](https://www.patreon.com/posts/130012991)\n\nCarlos joined the gathering of his house for their by-now-routine flight to a new area with even higher-level aether, feeling rather cheerful. He nodded to Amber, who was already there and waiting for him. He looked around, mentally checking off the roster of people, and was unsurprised to find he was the last to arrive. *No one's looking impatient or annoyed, at least.* He shrugged, then rolled his shoulders and theatrically stretched. \"Ready for our first time doing this by our own power?\"\n\nAmber grinned back at him, he felt her mana flex, and then she rose to hover a foot above the ground. \"What do you think? Can you keep up?\"\n\nCarlos smiled as he turned part of his focus inward and invoked the same Flight spell himself. Between greater specialization of his structures, greater synergies, and being almost Level 29 now, the casting was now completely silent. It was also a great deal faster than speaking the incantation would be, though still not quite as fast as activating a pre-prepared instance of the spell. *We'll close even that gap before much longer.* He rose into the air to join Amber. \"I can do this all day.\" He chuckled inwardly. *I've always wanted to say that and mean it.*\n\nCrown Mage Felton cleared his throat loudly before they could take it any farther. \"I received an update on the rotation agreement developments this morning that you should be wary of. The issue is escalating into greater open conflict. Several noble houses were raided yesterday, each of them either as yet neutral or openly supporting the Crown's stance.\"\n\nCarlos frowned and chewed his lip. \"Hmm. How is the Crown responding?\"\n\n\"Princess Lornera is sending squads of royal guards to protect loyal houses from any future raids, and Prince Patrimmon demolished High House Briston's main castle as a warning. Open defiance of the Crown will not be tolerated.\"\n\nCarlos cocked his head, thinking. \"Sounds like anyone who might want to go after us has bigger problems to worry about right now.\"\n\nFelton shrugged. \"Perhaps. Or someone might decide to go for a target they can actually beat.\"\n\nCarlos shared a look with Amber, then looked down at Purple, over at Colonel Lorvan and Major Ordens of the Crown Guards, flicked his gaze across Trinlen and the elite adventuring party prepared for their flight and Kindar, who no longer needed protection from the aether around them, and finally looked back at Felton himself. \"If so, I suspect they'll find they've bitten off more than they can chew.\"\n\nFelton held his gaze for a few seconds, then slowly nodded. \"Perhaps so, especially if you achieve a full breakthrough in analyzing the sabotage. We shall see.\"\n\n\\___\n\nJamar Tostral, fourth scion of her house, felt the final product of her day's efforts solidify into finality, and slumped in exhaustion. *Finally. Three unified structures at Tier 8 done, and I've made the first part of the Tier 7 one.* She sighed and all but collapsed into her bedding. *Spending all day every day relentlessly focusing on my advancement is incredibly bothersome, but it will all be worth it in the end. I'll pull ahead of Carlos, and he'll never know what hit him!*\n\n\\___\n\nRoyal Guard Captain Yolon suppressed a yawn of boredom as he marched along the walls of Castle Lerjen. He swept his gaze searchingly across the twilight horizon, yet again finding nothing unusual. *Come on, you bastards, it's been two whole days! Where's the exciting combat I was hoping for on this assignment? Don't tell me you chickened out already, after that display of dozens of concurrent raids.*\n\nHe glanced over the familiar sight of the castle's interior. One squad of House Lerjen's own guards was doing combat drills in a cordoned-off section of the courtyard, and occasionally someone randomly strolled along one of the paved paths on some unknown errand. Other squads manned the ramparts of the castle, and they were passably attentive to their duties, but Yolon had noticed them grumbling about it when they thought he couldn't hear. *They're putting on a show to try to look good in front of the Crown Guards, all four of us that are here, but they don't truly take their jobs seriously.* He restrained himself from shaking his head at them. *They'd be of limited usefulness anyway; their soul plans are weak. Then again, I suppose they're likely on par with the raiders – if any raid ever actually shows up here.*\n\nYolon returned his attention to the surrounding countryside. *House Lerjen didn't get hit by the first wave of raids, but that means the people who did this will be more likely to hit them the next time, right?* The daylight was nearly done fading into night, but that didn't pose much of an obstacle to any royal guard.\n\nAn alert popped up in his helmet, but he smoothly continued his march, hiding any outward sign that anything had happened. *Hmm? A Level 35 mana signature, likely a person, approaching at speed. Could this be it, finally?* Another alert popped up, marking the approach of another dozen slightly weaker mana signatures coming just behind the first one. At the same moment, he spotted movement with his enhanced eyesight in the locations the alerts had marked. *Yep, definitely people, definitely armed, and definitely not friendly. Excellent.* He grinned and covertly readied himself to spring into action.\n\nHe watched as the lead figure reached the base of the wall and ran up it to the top. The assailant had chosen his entry point well, in the deepest dimness between lights and as far as possible from any House Lerjen guards. At the last moment, Yolon flew across a hundred feet of distance to meet him with his spear, stabbing straight through the man's armor to impale his heart. Yolon observed the enchanted spike in the man's left hand and the long chains hanging from it, which the other hostiles were already starting to grasp at below, and kicked the man's corpse off from his spear. The body hit the ground with a heavy thud, and the dozen or so other attackers paused as if frozen in shock and uncertainty.\n\nYolon looked down at them and shook his head exasperatedly. *Really? Is that all?*\n\n\\___\n\nRoyal Guard Captain Serbin cursed to himself as he deflected yet another strike from a heavy mace. *Who the hell are these people? Did a high house send all of their best elites for this? Why is High House Miyob worth such a commitment?*\n\nHe ducked, blocked, parried, and dodged attack after attack from the six enemies surrounding him, uncomfortably aware of how many hits had already gotten through to hit his armor. He lashed out and spun with his spear extended, but his opponents smoothly backed off just far enough and then flowed back in like dancers to resume pressing their advantage. Another blow rang off of his helmet, and he lunged forward to make use of the imparted momentum. His spear sank its tip into a joint of his target's armor, but the enemies on either side forced him to withdraw before he could leverage the strike into more than a shallow nick of the flesh beneath.\n\n*Someone should have joined me by now, unless the entire squad is as beset as I am, and House Miyob's forces as well. My armor can't take many more hits this strong, either.* Serbin parried three attacks at once, shoved the collection of weapons back, and touched his mana to a specific control point in his armor even as he whirled to fend off the attacks of his other three opponents. Bright light flashed, thunder roared, and most importantly, a powerful wave of mana erupted in all directions, crafted to inflict a bout of dizziness on anyone it touched.\n\nThe effect wouldn't work for long against opponents of this caliber, but Serbin didn't need long for what he intended. He leaped upward, gaining dozens of feet of altitude in an instant before he even engaged his armor's flight enchantment. He soared higher and quickly took stock of the situation. First, he looked to the locations of his subordinates, marked on his armor's displayed map. All three were at their assigned posts, all three fighting valiantly against groups of four.\n\nCorporal Prola had killed one, but three more still had him hemmed in and were keeping him thoroughly busy. The other two royal guards in his squad were each fighting four enemies, organized in pairs that covered for each other. As for House Miyob's standing forces, half of them were down already, and the rest were fiercely engaged in a sprawling brawl all across the walls. Reinforcements were starting to arrive from the barracks, but they were having trouble getting to the places they were needed.\n\nSerbin looked back at where he'd just jumped from, and saw that three of his own opponents had taken flight to pursue him in the air, while the other three had equipped bows and were about to shoot at him. *Already? Damn, that was even faster than I expected.* He juked sharply, speeding back and downward a dozen feet. Two arrows zipped through where he'd just been, and his flying foes struggled to turn as sharply as he had, but the third archer had waited just a moment longer and adjusted for his evasive maneuver. He reacted just fast enough to turn it into a glancing blow on his leg, but it still hit.\n\n*Dammit, we need backup. Time to call it in.* He triggered the emergency signal enchantment and dove for the wall. *Here's hoping that these people don't have the fancy sabotage stuff we were warned about.* He landed on the wall with a loud clang, his spear leading the way, and a last-second flicker of his spear to one side finally caught an enemy off guard enough to land a decisive hit. The archers had already dropped their bows, but he caught one of them still drawing his mace, making his movements too awkward to defend properly until it was too late.\n\nThen the other three enemy soldiers, who seemed to have been assigned to harass him personally, caught up with him again, and he barely managed to pull his spear back out quickly enough to defend adequately. He exchanged blows perhaps a dozen more times, taking more hits on his armor in exchange for at best superficial wounds in return, before something changed.\n\nA new presence appeared, unmistakable even with his undeveloped raw mana sense, and a wave of pressure washed over the entire battle. A feeling of absolute *power* descended upon them all, and three of Serbin's five remaining opponents trembled in fear. He grinned and took advantage of the moment of distraction to cut off one's hand and stab the throat of another. And then the battle ended.\n\nPrincess Lornera Kalor, resplendent in her orichalcum raiment, beheaded two of Serbin's three remaining opponents with a casual sweep of her hands, grabbed the last one by the throat, and proceeded to carry her captive around the battlements while she dealt with the few pockets of raiders who didn't give up before she reached them. Serbin, ever dutiful, swept along the wall to the left while the princess went right, but even he encountered little real resistance. Most of his would-be opponents recognized that the princess's arrival made any further fighting pointless.\n\nCaptain Serbin marched over to Princess Lornera and held a salute until she eventually acknowledged him. Lornera gazed at the man she'd dragged around a battle by the neck, then sighed and tossed him aside. \"I went to the bother of taking him alive, and he responded with some manner of suicide. Oh well, I doubt he had any truly important information to divulge anyway. We already know who is responsible for this – the faction of nobles agitating about the rotation agreement.\"\n\nLornera straightened and faced the captain squarely. \"Alright, Captain… Serbin? Report.\"\n\n\\___\n\nThe next day, High Lord Recindril Tostral leaned forward over the pile of reports on his desk and restrained a groan. *So many raids failed. I didn't expect the Crown to respond so decisively. We could have handled the royal guards.* He grimaced. *Well, in some of the raids, anyway. But personal intervention by the Kalor scions? How can we possibly handle* that *when they just show up* anywhere *without warning?*\n\nHe shuffled some papers around, sorting through what assets he could call on. *I might have to talk some nobles into personally taking part in this to handle the royal guards well, but even that would fall short against a Crown prince.* He stared at a summary of available combatants, willing it to somehow expand with a solution, then shook his head at his own silliness. *We might have to move up the timetable and just go with the houses we already have on our side. Well, let's see, just what would that look like…*\n\nLord Recindril was absorbed deeply in an analysis of wargaming a civil war scenario – rather than the full rebellion scenario he was hoping for – when someone knocked on his door. The knock repeated, and he looked up and glared at the door for a moment. \"This had better be important. I'm busy.\"\n\n\"A delivery for you, my lord.\" The reply was muffled somewhat by the closed door, but still clear.\n\nRecindril blinked, then rushed to the door and slammed it open. \"A *delivery?* Who even knows where this place is, to be *able* to send a delivery here?\"\n\nOne of his soldiers stood at the door and bowed to him, holding out an envelope. \"No idea, my lord, but it came with a letter addressed to you.\"\n\nRecindril looked at the envelope, eyed it suspiciously for a moment, then grabbed it. It was labeled with his name and title on the front and sealed with a powerfully-enchanted circle of wax, marked with only the runes of its enchantment. He recognized the feel of a lock enchantment waiting for the right mana signature – *his* mana signature – to unlock it, and quickly provided it.

    "body": "# Scientists Say NIH Officials Told Them To Scrub mRNA References on Grants\n\nBy [**Arthur Allen**](https://kffhealthnews.org/news/author/arthur-allen/)March 16, 2025\n\n\n\nModerna's covid-19 vaccine was created using mRNA technology. Scientists are now worried the Trump administration is going to curtail mRNA research. (Eric Lee for The Washington Post via Getty Images)\n\nNational Institutes of Health officials have urged scientists to remove all references to mRNA vaccine technology from their grant applications, two researchers said, in a move that signaled the agency might abandon a promising field of medical research.\n\n# Use Our Content\n\nIt can be [republished for free.](https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/nih-grants-mrna-vaccines-trump-administration-hhs-rfk/view/republish/)\n\nThe mRNA technology is under study at the NIH for prevention and treatment of infectious diseases, including flu and AIDS, and [also cancer](https://www.sciencefriday.com/segments/pancreatic-cancer-vaccine/). It was deployed in the development of covid-19 vaccines credited with [saving 3 million lives](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/covid-19/report-covid-19-vaccines-saved-us-115-trillion-3-million-lives) in the U.S. alone — an accomplishment [President Donald Trump bragged about](https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-operation-warp-speed-vaccine-summit/) in his first term.\n\nA scientist at a biomedical research center in Philadelphia wrote to a colleague, in an email reviewed by KFF Health News, that a project officer at NIH had “flagged our pending grant as having an mRNA vaccine component.”\n\n“It’s still unclear whether mRNA vaccine grants will be canceled,” the scientist added.\n\nNIH officials also told a senior NIH-funded vaccine scientist in New York state, who does not conduct mRNA vaccine research but described its efficacy in previous grant applications, that all references to mRNA vaccines should be scrubbed from future applications.\n\nScientists relayed their experiences on the condition of anonymity for fear of professional retaliation by the Trump administration.\n\nA senior official at the National Cancer Institute confirmed that NIH acting Director Matthew Memoli sent an email across the NIH instructing that any grants, contracts, or collaborations involving mRNA vaccines be reported up the chain to Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s office and the White House.\n\nMemoli sent a similar message ahead of the agency canceling other research, such as studies of vaccine hesitancy.\n\nMemoli’s email on that topic bluntly stated that NIH was not interested in learning why people shun vaccines or in exploring ways to “improve vaccine interest and commitment.”\n\n# [Email Sign-Up](https://kffhealthnews.org/email/)\n\nSubscribe to KFF Health News' free Morning Briefing.\n\n Your Email Address\n\nThe National Cancer Institute official, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals, said that “it is reasonable to assume mRNA vaccine work is next.”\n\nThe official said a similar memo also went out regarding NIH-funded work in South Africa, which the White House has targeted over false claims that the country’s government is persecuting white people. More recently, another one went out regarding all global research collaborations, the official said.\n\nSpokespeople for the White House, HHS, and the NIH did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe NIH, whose latest annual budget was $47 billion, is one of the world’s most critical sources of funding for basic biomedical research. Its mission and programs are under unprecedented scrutiny from Trump’s White House and the Department of Government Efficiency, the Elon Musk-led agency created by a Trump executive order that has directed federal agencies to prepare for widespread layoffs.\n\nThe NIH is funding at least 130 studies involving the mRNA technology in covid vaccines produced by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna that have been administered to billions of people worldwide.\n\nA former government official familiar with internal discussions said that the Trump administration intends to cut some grants for mRNA vaccine research but that the timing is unclear. The person spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect relationships with the administration.\n\nPolitical conservatives in the U.S. have promulgated conspiracy theories, unsupported by scientific evidence, that the shots and their relatively new technology are dangerous. This has undermined public support for covid vaccinations and mRNA research.\n\n“There will not be any research funded by NIH on mRNA vaccines,” the scientist in New York said in an interview. “MAGA people are convinced that these vaccines have killed and maimed tens of thousands of people. It’s not true, but they believe that.”\n\nMeanwhile, hundreds of other vaccine-related studies are in limbo. Kawsar Talaat, a vaccine researcher at the Bloomberg School of Public Health at Johns Hopkins University, has been waiting since the fall for money needed to recruit subjects for a study of an antidiarrheal vaccine.\n\n“NIH approved our funding,” she said, “and now we’re waiting, and we don’t know if it’s going forward or going to be killed.”\n\nThe scientist in Philadelphia signaled that he believes Kennedy, a longtime anti-vaccine activist, is responsible for the NIH’s turn against mRNA research.\n\n“Kennedy’s war on vaccines has started,” the scientist told his colleague.",

With a 30 mm chain gun, Hellfire missiles, and Stinger air-to-air rockets, the AH-64E is a battlefield force multiplier.\n\n# Blades of Power: Apache Helicopters Boost India’s Western Front Firepower\n\nThe Apaches were delivered as part of a six-unit order signed with Boeing, with further procurement likely based on evolving tactical requirements. Unlike the Indian Air Force, which has operated Apaches since 2019, this marks the [Army](https://worldmagzine.com/live/tragic-midair-collision-american-eagle-jet-and-army-helicopter-crash-near-dc/)’s first direct deployment of the platform. Positioned in Rajasthan, they are strategically located for quick deployment along the Indo-Pak border.\n\nEach Apache is equipped with advanced night vision, thermal imaging, and helmet-mounted displays, allowing it to dominate in low-visibility conditions. These capabilities are essential for India’s western deserts, where temperature extremes and open terrain pose unique challenges. The aircraft’s combat systems enable pilots to strike without revealing their location, thanks to terrain-hugging radar design.\n\nImportantly, these helicopters are not entirely foreign-made. Their fuselages were assembled by the Tata-Boeing joint venture in Hyderabad, supporting India’s Make in India initiative. This localization reduces logistical dependency and strengthens the nation’s defense manufacturing [ecosystem](https://worldmagzine.com/business/nano-labs-rebrands-subsidiary-nano-bit-accelerates-bitcoin-ecosystem-entry/), which is vital for long-term strategic autonomy.\n\nThe timing of this induction—soon after Operation Sindoor and amid cross-border tensions—underscores India’s proactive stance. The Apaches serve as both a defensive deterrent and an offensive asset capable of swift retaliation. Their presence alone complicates enemy planning and adds psychological pressure to any cross-border mobilization.\n\nThe AH-64E Apache helicopters are more than [machines](https://worldmagzine.com/business/need-of-currency-note-counting-machines-for-indian-apple-stores/)—they’re a bold strategic signal, reinforcing India’s resolve and redefining aerial combat potential along its western frontier.\n\nLearn More: [https://worldmagzine.com/world/redefining-power-indias-apache-helicopters-near-pakistan/](https://worldmagzine.com/world/redefining-power-indias-apache-helicopters-near-pakistan/)",

    "body": "Original Article: [https://www.juniorstocks.com/enbridge-launches-900-m-solar-farm-to-fuel-meta-s-clean-energy-goals](https://www.juniorstocks.com/enbridge-launches-900-m-solar-farm-to-fuel-meta-s-clean-energy-goals)\n\nLegacy energy meets next-gen tech as Enbridge partners with Meta to power AI data centers with US$900 million Texas solar project\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/petgevp3jgef1.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=469792b430041bde766ecbfa87bc948870ed36e2\n\nIn a bold step that signals the evolving intersection of big tech and big energy, Enbridge Inc. is investing US$900 million in a solar power project in Texas designed to meet the colossal energy demands of Meta Platforms Inc. The Calgary-based pipeline giant, traditionally known for moving oil across North America, is now pushing further into renewables with a 600-megawatt development called the Clear Fork project, located near San Antonio. Construction has already begun, with completion targeted for the summer of 2027.\n\nThis is not just another solar installation. It is a strategic alliance between two corporate heavyweights from very different sectors. Meta, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, has inked a long-term agreement to buy the full output from the solar farm. With data centers increasingly at the heart of the AI revolution, and with their massive electricity needs, Meta’s move reflects an urgent pivot toward renewable energy solutions that are as scalable as they are sustainable.\n\nMatthew Akman, president of Enbridge’s power business, called the deal a reflection of growing demand from blue-chip tech firms. Clear Fork, he said, represents the next generation of renewable energy investment, one backed by financial muscle, deep supply chain logistics and proven construction capabilities. Akman emphasized the low-risk commercial model behind the project, noting that it is structured to deliver competitive returns without sacrificing environmental goals.\n\nThe timing couldn’t be more telling. With global concerns mounting over emissions from fossil fuels and with the U.S. government offering extensive support for clean energy development, traditional energy companies like Enbridge are under pressure to adapt. But instead of simply reacting, Enbridge is positioning itself as a player in the solution. The company has already funneled more than US$8 billion into renewable energy since 2002, spanning 23 wind farms, 13 solar facilities and one geothermal project. Collectively, that infrastructure generates enough electricity to power 1.3 million homes.\n\nFor Meta, this is more than a green PR move. It’s about energy certainty in a high-stakes, high-growth industry. Data centers don’t just power likes and shares anymore. They’re the muscle behind machine learning, AI training models and real-time content delivery. As the digital economy swells, so too does its appetite for electricity. Urvi Parekh, Meta’s head of global energy, said the company was thrilled to partner with Enbridge and reaffirmed Meta’s commitment to operating entirely on clean power.\n\nTexas may seem like an odd fit for a solar surge, but it’s fast becoming ground zero for the energy transition. With vast land, abundant sunshine and a deregulated power market, the Lone Star State is proving it can host more than just oil rigs and cattle ranches. This isn’t the first time tech and energy have crossed paths in Texas, but Clear Fork marks one of the most significant efforts to date by a legacy energy firm to directly feed the operations of a Silicon Valley juggernaut.\n\nThe Clear Fork project is not just about electrons. It’s about ambition, transformation and leverage. Enbridge is taking decades of experience in large-scale infrastructure and pivoting it toward a market that’s only going to grow. Meta is locking in a green future to power a digital one. And the partnership suggests that when old and new industries align on renewable goals, the results are anything but incremental. They’re paradigm-shifting.",

    "body": "**It is my firm belief that the devil waits at crossroads so he may wordlessly offer men a choice. To ascent to evil or to turn away and find righteousness. Musicians, Artists, Alchemists of old. Many among them pilfered the darkness to catch a glimpse of light.**  \n\n  \n\n\n  \n  \n\n\nWalking along a dusty trail, far too narrow for a comfortable stride, flanked on each side by dense tree cover, stood two young men. One, 19 years old, another barely 14, each wielding an old fashioned oil lantern.\n\n\n\nEach step brought about a flicker from their lamps, the quivering flame conducting the gaunt shadows of the trees to which they begrudgingly danced a languid dance. \n\n\n\nG: Where do we go?\n\nA softer voice asked. Somewhat encumbered by a lack of knowledge. \n\n\n\nF: Just up here. \n\nA more gruff voice answered.\n\n \n\nMinutes passed, the roots on the trail once barely noted now criss-crossed in a tight weave, what little comfort the leaf litter or dirt provided now overshadowed by the buried gnarled bones of a long dead Forest. \n\n\n\nF: My dad said him and his buddies used to drink out in the green ring of the woods here, but only “tourists” (meaning hippies) and drug addicts would come out this far.\n\nG: Seems like a long way just to smoke pot.\n\nF: Nah, I’m talking needles and pipes. Apparently he would see them like, freaking out and yelling and stuff. \n\nG: Maybe they were possessed. That's why they were going crazy\n\nF: His buddies had to throw bottles and shit to scare em off. If they were demons, they wouldn’t have been scared of bottles. \n\nG: Or they’re like, imps. \n\nF: That’s not a thing. \n\nG: Yeah they are. \n\nF: Yeah well, not in this situation they aren't, \n\n  \n\n\nThe trail grew louder. Branches and sticks and fragments of leaves crunched beneath our feet, the wood squeaking and snapping with our weight, \n\n\n\nG: Do you think your dad knew about the fence? Or just the 49er?\n\nF: I didn't talk to him about the fence. I only heard about it from my buddy. The one that worked in forestry. \n\nG: I would have thought it was the dentist.\n\nF: Fuck off and come back when youre funny. \n\nG: I’m kidding I’m kidding. Jeez.\n\nF: Plus I feel like these types of things start with dudes like uh…\n\n\n\nFranklin was interrupted by the crunch of glass beneath his feet. Sitting in the recess of two roots was an old hypodermic needle covered in a thick green slime, the stale stink of fungus and rot filling the immediate area.\n\n\n\nF: I think that means we’re close.\n\n\n\nAs we continued to walk, the anemic and dying forest was replaced with a near perfect grid of old spruce trunks devoid of any branches. The chthonic spears of wood reached at least 50 feet into the air before abruptly ending in a single forked trunk which would have ended in a canopy. The roots twisted and grew around one another into what more resembled a floor beneath our feet. It was less than comfortable, the occasional root stretching over the other nearly tripping the both of us.  \n\n\n\nG: Dude this sucks..\n\nF: Yeah I know, it’s kinda boring.\n\nG: No like, this shit feels wrong.\n\nF: Well yeah, it was an abandoned spruce farm. One of those man-made forests or something. None of it’s natural. \n\nG: Why was it abandoned?\n\nF: I think it was beetles or something. Whatever swept through started killing everything here. That’s what my buddy said anyways. \n\nG: Do you think it has something to do with the fence? Or the 49er? \n\nF: Why would I know that? As long as we have the lanterns and what I got in my bag, we should be good. \n\n\n\nFranklin gestured to his thick canvas backpack. Inside was oil for the lamps, walkie talkies, a few snacks, four beers, lighters, our phones, some rope, and a few shiny metal discs I couldn't make out at the bottom. \n\n\n\nThe old story with the 49er goes that he was some prospector from California who went crazy and killed a bunch of people panning for gold up here in Oregon. He would steal from the lucky ones, though I guess their luck was disputable since they never got the chance to claim the gold they found. It was a pretty big legend in the area. Not that we learned about it in school, but anyone who didn't know had the chance to hear it from a local. \n\n\n\nF: You know the thing about the rivers and streams? How you can see him panning for gold if you walk by?\n\nG: Yeah? \n\nF: Apparently this whole forest was grown on a dried up river bed. The water got diverted for the old dam. \n\nF: I’m thinking this was one of the places he was panning for gold. Hell, maybe he even killed someone out here. \n\n\n\nThere were sightings of the 49er around all the rivers and streams in the town, but for some reason, Franklin only seemed to care about the ones that overlapped with this forest. \n\n\n\nI think it had to do with his sister. Apparently she went camping with her friends and wandered off in Calhoun state park a while back when I was in elementary school. It devastated our whole family, Franklin especially.That state park ain’t too far from these woods, maybe two or three miles north.\n\n\n\nAfter another 5 or so minutes of walking, we got to the first important landmark. It was the only tree with branches in this area, and seemed to be the only one that wasn’t a spruce. An old hollow tree with what looked like dirt and trash filling it. The hollow stretched from the ground to about midway up my torso. The greasy feeling of colored candle wax beneath our boots leading us further into the hollow wood. I stepped on it with a satisfying squish. It was still malleable. Warm? \n\n\n\nThe smell that emanated from the hollow was putrid. Reminiscent of the garbage behind a seafood restaurant. Bones and what smelled like composted fish filled the hollow and spilled out before us. \n\n\n\nWithout skipping a beat, as if he knew what to do, Franklin took out a can of tuna and began to open it.\n\n\n\nG:…What?\n\nF: What? \n\nG: Why are you doing that?\n\nF: I’m Feeding it.\n\n\n\nThe nonchalant response immediately distressed me, but his chuckle somewhat reassured me.\n\n\n\nF: Nah im just fucking with you. Apparently you need to leave something here to find the fence. My buddy said meat or fish worked. \n\n\n\nI stared at him like he was crazy. \n\n\n\nF: Hey man, it’s just what he said. He’s an ass, but I don’t want to take any chances with this stuff. \n\n\n\nAfter opening it, Franklin threw the tuna, can and all into the hollow.\n\n\n\nG: So…. Left or right?\n\nF: We need to walk around this tree first. 7 times.\n\nG: Your buddy said to walk around the tree seven times. \n\nF:…….Yeah.\n\nG: Franklin?\n\nF: Yes Garrett?\n\nG: You’re a jackass.\n\n\n\nWe both started to laugh as he went over to grab me, but both stopped fooling around as we heard a gunshot in the distance. \n\n\n\nG: Dude. We need to get out of here. What if there are hunters or something? All this shit is private.\n\nF: Quit being a puss. You really want me to tell everyone back home how much of a loser Garret Quincy is? \n\nG: It’s just weird, alright? Why would your buddy give us this dumb lead? \n\nG: No. I know why. To mess with us. He, is fucking with us.\n\nF: C'mon little dude. Where’s your sense of adventure? Or are you too scared?\n\n\n\nFranklin began to walk around, putting on different exaggerated expressions of fear or panic with each rotation around the tree.\n\n\n\nG: I just don’t feel right about this. \n\n\n\nBefore I began my walk around and as Franklin finished his 7th loop, a howling breeze forced me into a speed walk as Franklin went into his backpack for his phone and mine.\n\nFranklin flipped it open.\n\n  \n\n\nF: No signal. \n\nG: That’s horror movie shit.\n\nF: Relax. We’re barely 4 miles from town. Plus we have the Walkies, and the surprise I mentioned right here.\n\n\n\nAs I finished my final loop, he pulled out a leather bound journal and what looked like an orange barreled revolver, just without any of the moving parts save the firing pin, and broke it open, revealing a flare.\n\n\n\nF: If we see any monsters or ghosts we can just shoot ‘em with this. \n\nG: Where’d you get a flare gun?\n\nF: bought it.\n\nG: From where? \n\nF: Camping store. \n\nG: And you didn’t think like, holy water or something would be better to fight a ghost? \n\nF: I’m sure he won’t \\*enjoy\\* being shot by a flare gun. And it’s more for if we find a black bear or something.\n\nG: You are insane. \n\n\n\nHe handed me a walkie talkie and some extra batteries.\n\n\n\nFranklin opened up the notebook and began to study it.\n\nF: Alright, let’s go left. \n\n\n\nI began to follow Franklin as we zig-zagged through the trees. After what felt like forever, we arrived.\n\n\n\nA rusty chain link fence stood before us. Bright red with the exception of the three poles holding it together which were only stained where they met the wire, the fence was diagonally placed between two trees. Adorning the fence were a dozen padlocks. They seemed to greatly vary in age. Three or so were almost entirely rusted over.\n\n\n\nG: So this is the fence? \n\nF: No.\n\nG: Haha, very funny.\n\nF: No. I’m serious. My uh…buddy said it was completely different. Like nothing you’ve ever seen. \n\n\n\nG: So what's this?\n\nF: I don’t know. Maybe it’s to give us a reason to leave. We saw what we came to see, so we can just leave now right? \n\nG: You say it like the fence is choosing to do it.\n\n\n\nFranklin didn’t say anything. He just stood there, his mouth agape and his eyes wide. I turned my head to see what he was looking at. \n\n\n\nOn the fence post hung a collection of 3 stained bracelets. Seemingly homemade, strings of beads and charms came together, one with letters stood out, and spelled a name. \n\n\n\nF: Harlie….\n\n\n\nThe realization crept up my spine. I was at a loss for words. The lump in my throat refused to budge, and the shaking in Franklin’s voice didn’t make it any easier. She was here. She had to have been. Right?\n\n\n\nWithout saying a word, Franklin grabbed the bracelets and put them in his pocket.\n\n\n\nG: D…do you…\n\n\n\nF: What? Do I what?\n\n\n\nHis curt tone made me briefly waver in my question. Franklin’s face was locked in a scowl tempered by the steadfastness of his motions. I was initially going to ask if this was still his buddy just messing with us, but it felt wrong to even suggest such a thing. Instead, I forced out a half baked question. \n\n\n\nG: Do you think we should leave? \n\n\n\nFranklin stood quietly for a second, twisting the roots under his shoe, breaking up what little dirt and bark sat atop. \n\n\n\nF: You’re thinking of chickening out? You wanna leave me alone with all this?\n\nG: Dude, calm down. I’m just saying, it’s late, we were drinking earlier, and I think we should regroup. \n\n\n\nFranklin rubbed his temples and eyes. \n\n\n\nF: Yeah. Yeah maybe. Shit, sorry dude. \n\n\n\nG: It’s okay. Let’s just get out of here. \n\n\n\nFranklin put away his notebook, the worn leather was cracking in some places. Only this close was I able to make out crudely cut lettering on it. \n\n\n\n“U.L.C”\n\nAs well as a series of numbers I couldn’t entirely make out.  \n\n\n\nFranklin cracked open a beer and started to drink. His face proved it wasn’t exactly cold anymore, but any apprehension was pushed to the side by a need to feel some sort of worldly comfort.\n\n\n\nWe began to walk back. Despite his relaxed demeanor, and what I liked to call a “false elder” attitude Franklin couldn’t hold his alcohol at all. Not that he became surly at the drop of a bottle, but his attitude was quick to change with the introduction of a little liquid courage. After a bit, he tried to break the silence. \n\n\n\nF: Dude, that hungry tree shit could be like, a thing. Like you send dudes in here for courage and shit. Test of mettle and all that. Mettle….weird word. \n\nG:….\n\nG: Maybe pass me one of those beers.\n\n\n\nFranklin reached into one of his bags and pulled out a little bottle of what seemed like vodka. The ones that you get on flights or something. I think it even had an airline logo on it. \n\n\n\nG: I hate liquor. \n\n\n\nF: Sorry, left this in my bag. Have you ever had vodka? \n\n\n\nG: I’ve smelled hand sanitizer. I was never dumb enough to taste it. \n\n\n\nF: fair enough, honestly. \n\n\n\nF: I have a summer ale, a wheat beer, aaaaaan…..\n\n\n\nFranklin was cut off by a rustling in the woods. We lifted our lanterns.\n\n\n\nWhat lay there was massive. It looked like a deer. Leucistic, or something. Laying down, barely whining at first. Its fur was white as snow, save the streaks and blotches of blood all over it. \n\n\n\nWhatever that “thing” was, it was looking right at us. Its horns were covered in what looked like skin, meat, and blood. Its eyes glowed a pale green in the night.\n\n\n\nI could feel the air all around me stagnate for a second before blasting it’s way into my lungs with a force opposite to that of falling down stairs straight onto your back.  \n\n\n\nThe monster’s mouth hung open, revealing flat blackened teeth. It groaned in an unnaturally deep cadence, whining and nearly barking at us.  \n\n\n\nIt seemed stuck in a walking motion even on its side. Weakly crawling in the air.  \n\n\n\nF: Garret….back up slowly. \n\n\n\nUpon careful observation, four rattlesnakes coiled each leg of the deer. Their teeth sinking into the meaty parts of its thigh. Blood pooled and dripped all the way to its hooves, and. With a particularly frantic set of thuds, the deer sunk its foot far into the tree and moss next to it as we took a step closer. Even as we got close, the snakes were silent as anything. \n\n\n\nA mix of splinters soft as cork and blood sprayed in all directions and landed in my eyes. Instinctively bringing my arm to my stinging eyes, I burnt myself with the lantern and dropped it. \n\n\n\nMy eyes closed, the sound of the flare gun clicking and a little pop alongside sounds of frustration were all I could hear. \n\n\n\nG: Franklin! Help!\n\n\n\nA loud crunch followed by a legion of dry rattles all around me faded when Franklin grabbed my arm and started to run with me. We barely made it 7 or so steps before a loud animalistic scream filled the woods all around us. \n\n\n\nI feel like I shouldn’t have done it, but it was beyond instinct. I needed to know what happened. \n\n\n\nI opened my eyes. \n\n\n\nBlood covered my iris, filtering the light of the now roaring fire into my eyes. \n\n\n\nShadowy naked figures danced in flames. They didn’t stand idly, nor did they move with panic. All they did was dance their horrible dance, jumping in long strides through the flame like it was little more than air. By the time I noticed we were all but too far away to act on it.\n\n\n\nI’ll never forget them. Their obscured faces turned to meet us regardless of their movement. What looked like black soot covered their faces exposing the whites of their eyes. \n\n\n\nDespite their ritual, the only thing I heard was the sizzling of fire and the wretched screams of that poor dear. Looking around as I ran, I saw more of the figures scattered about and between the trees, watching us. \n\n\n\nAfter what felt like a marathon of running, we finally made it to a gravel path. \n\n\n\nF: Fuck. FUCK. SHIT. \n\n\n\nG: What do we do?\n\n\n\nF: Leave. We leave and never speak a word of this to anyone. \n\n\n\nG: Okay….Okay…..\n\nWe both desperately panted for air. \n\nF: Dude your eye is covered in blood. Like, really covered in blood. \n\n\n\nMy vision was half stained red. I began rubbing my eyes. Tears welled up and the sensation of dryness overwhelmed me, I pulled my arm away, seeing a large crimson stain, far more blood than I would have thought. \n\n\n\nThe stain on my vision remained. \n\n\n\nG: What do you think was going on with those people? The ones dancing and stuff, and the ones in the trees?\n\n\n\nFranklin looked at me with genuine confusion.\n\n\n\n F: What people? \n\n\n\nEnd of chapter 1\n\n  \n  \n",

    "body": "**Date:** 22-Jul-25\n\nChina’s recent restrictions on key rare-earth exports, including dysprosium vital for high-performance magnets, have begun disrupting Apple’s electronics supply chain in India. At Foxconn’s plants for iPhones and AirPods in southern India, more than 300 Chinese engineers and technicians were suddenly recalled, slowing workforce training and complicating ramp-up for the next-generation iPhone 17. While Taiwanese replacements and Indian staff help, assembly efficiency and transfer of technical know‑how have been affected. This episode highlights India's dependence on Chinese materials, machinery, and specialized labor, underscoring the fragility of its “Make in India” and diversification ambitions. With Apple aiming to shift a large share of U.S.-bound iPhone production to India by 2026, the disruptions signal vulnerabilities in India’s electronics ecosystem amid geopolitical pressure. To fully realize its manufacturing potential and reduce external risks, India must accelerate development of local capabilities, diversify sourcing, and build resilient, in‑country supply chains.\n#IndianDefenceNews",
