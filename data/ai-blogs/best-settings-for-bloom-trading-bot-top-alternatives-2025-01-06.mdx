# Best Settings for BLOOM Trading Bot + Top Alternatives in 2024

I remember when I first started experimenting with crypto trading bots back in 2021 - it was like trying to solve a Rubik's cube blindfolded. Fast forward to 2024, and BLOOM has emerged as a game-changer in the automated trading space, especially when paired with FereAI's 0xMONK system.
